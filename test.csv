You end up with a 50% ratio of watching content and commercials. The audio works great on commercials, but during the shows it skips frames so often that you have to guess half of the statements.

addition, it consumed 1gb of data each day. The provider is copying and 
pasting the same response to all reviews to click on the ""contact us"" link 
within their app. I've uninstalled your app, so spare yourself the effort 
of copying and pasting your uninformative response to my review. You have 
cost your users immensely, and you don't have any incentive to compensate 
them. Your app had good features, for the two days I used it, aside from 
using 1gb of data per day in the background and draining my battery. You 
have also entirely discouraged me from using your app in the future due to 
your copying and pasting of your useless response to all cries for help in

Unfortunately the vast majority of my retirement accounts are invested in funds which aren't currently supported.   Additionally, it would be nice to be able to view a longer range of the higher fidelity performance graphs (can only see 4 months of 1D data).  Although overlaying information (Bollenger bands, SMA crossovers, RSI, etc) on graphs may make the interface more complicated, it would be nice to have the option to turn these on.  Update: Although premature, updated to 4 stars as developer indicated they will work on adding funds in future versions",0

I want all my transactions to show up uncategorized so I can ""approve"" them by assigning a category.

127973,Not easy to  sign in,1
127974,I'm on the fence about dropping the app. Accounts keep getting doubled and I can't delete them unless I go online. Clunky method of hiding things from the budget. Looking for a better app in the meantime.,2

127998,"This is a great app. Fairly easy to use and set up. Tracks a lot of different accounts. However, I've noticed a few problems. One being that it counts ONLY budgets for an entire month. I don't get paid monthly, I get paid biweekly, so I'd like to be able to set a budget for that. The other being that setting up the budget for the month as far as income goes is somewhat confusing. Where are these numbers coming from? A little more detail would be nice. Other than that, it's pretty good.",0

128001,"I just go in circles with confirmation codes and emails and code is expired, round and round...",0
128002,Quick and easy way to follow stock prices. The news used to only show the stocks on your watch list.  This newer version is cluttered with adds and every artical that references the S&P and DJ.  Very annoying to have to sift through all the junk.  I would only recommend this for stock quotes and not news.  You will miss important information.,1

128018,This app is pretty useful and fast. I like how the info I want is on the homepage. Make sure to turn off notifications; they are just news you  don't care about.

128029,experience w/ Android version. Latest update stinks. I keep having to fully close the app out and then reopen it for it to update prices. Otherwise it just stays on the last updated price. The bubble layout in list view just takes up more space & takes longer to scan my list. No improvements noticed just more ways to inject stupid ads into my view. Which makes me significantly less likely to click on one out of spite.,2

Your comments without violation of yahoo TOS are even removed and there are many that violates yahoo TOS never get baned many of those people has multiple names on yahoo finance and yahoo news boards.

128200,Great budgeting app but with a learning curve,0
128201,"New UI is utter garbage. I know this will be dismissed as people not liking change, but it has become impossible to find anything with the new, ""streamlined/simple"" design. Snapchat is not an example to follow. A budgeting app should have menus, not some swiping setup where nothing is labeled. You are also wasting screen space with massive, useless eye candy UI elements that add absolutely nothing. This app feels like a Fisher Price model made for toddlers.",1

128235,Like the black background,0
128236,"Way too many ads in the news feed! This is a recent addition. Also, most news articles require you to open them in a browser, and many are not even readable without a subscription to the third party site. In addition, when you add a new stock to your portfolio, it puts it at the top of the list, so everything is in the order that you added it. Your portfolio should be on alphabetical order! It makes it extremely difficult to find your stocks! Try Seeking Alpha instead.. much better app!",74

128268,Great platform...use it for all of my financial news and other news as well,0
128269,It really shows you your spending habbits and trends. It lets you set budgets for items you might be overspending on and whatnot. Only problem I find is it won't update my bank situation. The workaround is I add the same bank again... Then it doubles my info... Then I delete the previous entry... Its really annoying. Edit: never mind. After I went to settings and deleted the duplicate account it still shows I have double funds and won't update,0
128270,Easy to use and great information!,4

I've sent an email to support and was promised an answer within the next 24 hours. It's been more than 24 hours and still no answer.",2
128299,I'd particularly like a feature that speaks out a market futures index value each time it changes by a user defined amount.,0
128300,This money management app is easy to use and understand and works great! I've never had any problems. The best part is the widget that lets me see what's happening with my money right from my desk top. It is the best thing that has ever happened to my finances.,1

128331,I have used Mint for several years.   I love having all of my financial information all in one place. BUT this apps updates have made it less user friendly and have taken away some features that were previously available.   I'd like to see budgets for previous months but that is no longer available. The addition of the plus sign inside the circle on the lower right corner of the screen is annoying and I haven't figured out a way to get rid of it.  I wish I could go back to a previous version.,1
128332,"The widget won't let me change the watchlist, when you create a second widget it changes it too the first one and keeps both the same. It will not make them different. I wanted to have one for US and one for CANADA. Looks like I'll have to go back to the Stocks App instead. Also it would be nice if you can select a ""refresh time"" for the list but you cannot, the stock app allows this.",12

128341,"When this app works for me, it's great. It has a clean UI and a very handy widget. However, I've had it for almost a month now, and in that time it has maybe kept itself updated on my finances accurately for half that. Not sure if it's a problem on my bank's end or Intuit's, but it's not my job to find that out. It's definitely a useful app and a step in the right direction, but it's got some more work that needs done on the technical side to make it a keeper.",0

It's not quite as agile as I'd like.

I use Mint because the app is easy, convenient, and includes fingerprint security.",3

Getting rid of Mint Bills should NOT be done. Most of your users have come from there... It seemed fine at first but you haven't even updated Mint to be strong enough to support the entire Mint Bills and be even nearly half as efficient as it was. (I personally, for whatever reason, haven't even been able to find a way to add bills on my mint. Literally nowhere I can find the section to even start adding my bills... I'm desperately still trying to use Mint Bills to pay my bills on time and such... *sigh*). If this app doesn't get updated properly or mint bills does not stay, I'll be forced to move to the app called Prism. (Great alternative to this nonsense of an app).

I can add symbols or delete the entire list but I guess that is it. Seems to be a strange omission.

130219,it was fine before you messed with it ! Now it doesn't respond to my changes - takes about a minute - use to take no time. Change back to previous settings .,0

130234,"The old app was amazing, quick sync and all tabs were easily accessible similar to the webpage. The last update has unfortunately crippled the app. Slow sync, and often times it gets stuck trying to sync data giving me the ""eternal hourglass"", which requires me to force kill the app and restart. I've had several bills that I pay through the app but the app doesn't recognize that it already paid the bill so it generates new payment requests, resulting in duplicate payments. I keep the app on my phone just for the bill notifications, but I use the mobile webpage instead of the app for reviewing my financial data and paying bills.",6

130246,"Two steps forward, one step back. Every update to the app to add new features breaks existing features for weeks until a patch is issued. Look, I love mint, but the app developers need to learn how to Unit Test. Constantly logging me out, forgetting my thumbprint, opening the app to have no data or history until it syncs ""for the first time"", being shown helpful hints most times I open the app.... It's a mess, but at least it's free",10

130248,This is an excellent App with all the relevant updated information. Only request to promoters is Add Gold contract of MCX India which is not there. Also if possible more News be added. Thanks,4
130249,"I see the budgeting, cash flow, and spending habit tracking features as the primary benefits of this app, however you can only see information charted for the current month, which is completely useless. That means I can only see a complete breakdown of a month if it happens to be the last day of the month, and then it's gone once it's the 1st again. Please show historical graphs!!!",46

In that case if I click on the shortcut it simply opens a new app window and in that window I'm logged out and cannot login. That sux 2) user interface is overloaded with stuff I simply don't need. I need charts (brilliant!) and alarms (love it). I don't need trade buttons, I use my stock market instead. I don't need news and stuff. Please add option to remove all stuffed menu items in paid version. I'll pay. Just for alarms I'll pay %) 3) there are some minor user interface cons which I can describe you in a letter. Simply may be you should create profiles like a Cryptonoob, Forex trader, All in one... Etc",19

130715,Awesome app!!! Keep my finances in line!!!!,0
130716,"Inconsistent updates. No data for  days even if the app is open (no errors received).  The button is useless. It covers data, and ultimately feels like intuit copied it off Google without any for thought (playing me too games). Avoid mint till fixed. Used to be the best, now it is sub par. How do I go back to the previous version? This new one is bad, someone needs to be fired for this travesty.",4

130725,Informative and works smooth!,0
130726,"Previously I gave this app four stars.  Because it didn't show the number of shares that associated with my portfolio.  With the latest update,  the number of shares has been added. With that said,  I am now giving it 5 stars .  It provides what I need. I'm leaving my previous notes below to all to see the tremendously great changes that have occurred. I still use this app everyday Several times a day. (Request added) on the next upgrade, the app would show number of shares in my holdings.",2

130749,Mint has been amazing in keeping me informed about my credit score and showing me way's to raise it. They have a host of information to help you with anything pertaining to your money issues. Mint monitors your score for you for free unlike so many others. You can pay bills through them as well. Not sure how they can do all these things for free but I'm very happy they can. Mint has helped me immensely. Thank you Mint for all your help. Sincerely Elizabeth R,1

130754,Awesome. Best budgeting software,0
130755,Too much ads,1
130756,"Yeah. It worked for one day and now all my transactions across ALL accounts are duplicated. I've tried accessing the duplicate transaction menu, as per their help, but no dice. It makes it really frustrating for someone who is just starting to get their budget in line because that error causes the trends and budget side to be wrong. If I could get rid of this glitch I would upvote, but this is very frustrating.",14
130757,I have been super disappointed in the lack of updates and connectivity to a variety of accounts. I was super excited when they started supporting coinbase but even simple things like t-mobile money aren't there. New updates make trends and patterns harder to follow too. I hope they work on this soon!,4
130758,"Very useful app, it makes and saves me money.",0
130759,Got new phone downloaded yahoo to it. Now i get notifications way too often. I go to settings>notifications turn OFF everything. Then go back in and all notifications are back ON. It sucks. Other than that I like the app but not putting up with constant notifications.,2

130761,"Fantastic! I have been relying on Mint to give me instantaneous visibility into my entire financial world for many years. Transactions, investment gains and losses, home value, auto value, wife's credit card charges, all available 24/7.

Don't tell them, but I would pay a fair amount for Mint.",10
130762,"Great app to manage finances! Never been so organized with my money since I signed up with mint. They even saved me money when I can found unauthorized purchases. For that I thank mint!

130763,Easy to use and search symbols. Well played out. Always updated.,0

130777,Too many ads. Great platform for account overview but really don't like credit card offers thrown in my face. Would be nice if I could hide the ads for if I was ever interested. Won't let you drag them down from 3rd priority. .,1

130795,"News feed being filled more and more with feminist rhetoric. I want financial news, not further cultural brainwashing.",0
130796,Generally good financial data. Redundant business news from multiple sources with same story.  Way too many ads. When asked why deleted has no effect for future ads.,6
130797,Mint is one of the top apps on my phone. I use it daily to manage finances and keep track of budgets. It keeps all my accounts in one place so I don't have to log in to 15 other apps to check account balances. I have been a Mint user for over 5 years and I don't know where I'd be without it.,0
130798,This app used to be great now always has account issues. I wish I could go back to a version that worked.,3
130799,"I really like this app. The news feed stories are relevant to your watch lists and up-to-date. I wish you could also see indicators, but I'm sure that's a whole can of worms to put on a mobile app. Keep up the great work.",0

130806,Great way to keep track of expenses and save money if you're spending too much,0
130807,Terrible update!! VERY slow. Display has too much white space for a phone's screen. Charts are too small to be useful. The whole update requires too much handholding to be practical. Do not add advertising to this version or app will become completely useless. Are trying to get users to leave? You have already insulted us so remember most of us know there is competition for this app out there. Can I give 0 (no) stars?,5
130808,Borsa için en iyisi.,0
130809,"Works fine and I find it very useful, but why are no screenshots allowed? I hate that. I should be allowed to allow screenshots if I want. Instead, I need to go to my bank app or whatever anyway, which kind of means using Miny is a waste.",0

130824,It was 5 stars until the new update. Now I can't see the leftover budget amounts on lines where I have the unspent budget roll over. That was one of the best features of the monthly budgets.,0
130825,Goals are an important part of my budget. It makes no sense to have them on the website and not the app. It has been years and still no support for tracking goals.,2

130851,"Thank you, mint app, for putting an ""add account"" plus sign exactly where my thumb is trained to hit the refresh icon.  Like i really need the ""add account"" option right there in such a prominent position because adding a new account is something i really ought to do several.times a day. And yes, im being sarcastic.  Please get rid of this new addition, it adds no value and detracts from the app's functionality.",0
130852,"I downloaded it with the hopes that it would be a good way to keep track of my spending.It failed my expectations.  First off, it is having issues with connecting to my bank which means that the only transactions it shows are the transactions for my credit card accounts. This I don't need because my credit cards all tell me when I am reaching my limit or when my payments are due already.  Second, it picked categories for those transactions which were completely wrong. (My school tuition was labeled as clothing for example.) While I am alright with this because some of them were correct so does save some time, there wasn't an option to change all transactions from one company to the same category. (Repeat charges had to be corrected individually.)  Third, there is no option for adding monthly bills that aren't attached to credit cards or banks such as my NetFlix subscription.   Fourth, if there is no balance on an account, it still shows you that it is an upcoming bill. For the other app I tried recently and also didn't find useful, it at least didn't show me $0 balances.   It looks pretty, the credit score option is nice, the advice may be useful, but not a useful tracker",5
130853,Stocks High/Low price missing. Latest update removed the High and low of day for stocks. It's so obvious that whoever makes and approves changes to the app has ZERO knowledge and experience with stock quotes. Add this back ASAP!,29

130855,This has become my favorite site for stock quotes. Well formatted and real time quotes are useful.,1

It records my automated transfer of funds from checking to savings as if it's a debit to my savings when it should be a debit to my checking! It doesn't matter if I'm using Mint on the web or via the app - same frustrating experience. It's essentially useless to me 😡",0

The crash from the last update has been fixed and works just as advertised.

131583,I was using mint bills which was great a 5 out 5 and I told everyone to use it to keep track of their bills. I was forced to change to this new app which is horrible. I can't believe thst the company is getting rid of a great program with this uslless program for keeping track of your bills. I have given the company quite some time since they first announced the change hoping that they would get this program half as good as the old one but no luck not only do they deserve a one-star and they will no longer be getting my recommendation I'm going to tell everyone to stay away from anything this company does. I have never been more upset with an app company in my life. They have taken something that I have grown to depend on and given me something worthless for my needs.,10

131669,Live feed on stock prices soooo slow. It used to be live to the minute. Now its lagging sometimes not refreshing for up to 10 minutes. If you go to the charts on a particular stock the stock price stops updating. Have to go back to stock overview and then back into the charts. Lots of little bugs but currently its no longer useful to use and track stocks in real-time and in the charts real-time. Needs fixing. I'll use a different app from now on until its corrected.,67

Rather than just importing info from Mint Bills™ I DONT HAVE THESE CARDS FOR A REASON.  If we gotta make the transition to simplify our lives with these apps, that's great, but make sure the New Mint (Not Mint Bills) is flawless before shutting down Mint Bills.

Instead I have to choose from catagories like ""auto insurance"" and ""groceries"", things that you're always going to have to spend money on anyway and don't need to save for.

But I truly appreciated the simplicity pf Mint ... Until now. The update is a down grade. I figure this the mess we are getting now that will (in the thinking of Intuit execs) that will justify the charges that probably in future planning. Just because some Every Dollar comparisons said the app was not fancy or pretty, that is not a reason to change it. It is likely that most of the users do so because it was easy and simple.

This biller is supported in Mint Bills, which makes it even more confusing since they're both Intuit properties. I could accept the rest of the problems associated with them arbitrarily deciding to deprecate a useful app like Mint Bills if it supported an equal set of billers, but this annoys me too no end. If they'd fix this bug, which I'm told us known by Intuit, I'd give it a better rating.",1

It have some great features but too much ads or pop ups/recommendations.

Devs: Could improve by not exiting/discarding in-progress edits whenever a refresh completes, and needs to have a way to scroll to the bottom of a list that extends below the keyboard... Hiding the keyboard cancels the search, so you can never get to the bottom entries to select them when search results are more than a few entries long.",0

I only noticed because there were some big ones. I don't know how many little transactions are missing. I called mint and they 'elevated' the problem because they couldn't fix it.

132732,"Mint is OK, but it offers out of date information and hardly ever refreshes your accounts. There are no manual options to trigger a refresh, so you're left waiting for the app to randomly decide to give you updated information. There are better budgeting apps out there that WILL update your information often. Use Mint's data with a grain of salt. Also, the budgeting feauture could use some work. Things get miscategorized often and the categories are very limited.",0

132841,Still in development.  Very quirky.  Like a beta tested app. Doesn't show account but when you try to add says account already on. Makes you verify you're not a robot continuously.  Very annoying.  If trying to add acct you leave the app to say retrieve security code from text or email it resets every time.  So so so many bugs.,0
132842,"I use this app to check the markets daily, but I also have the app notify me about breaking stories. Whenever I hit these I get ""this story is still developing, check back later"". This is quite annoying. If I can't read about I don't want to be notified. Please fix this.",0

I emailed support in October, of course, they said it was something I did for the account not to update. I did everything they told me to do, it did not fix my problem. I emailed them back to let them know it was still not updated and they never responded. I have also experienced the ""account not found"" error more times than I can count. I am currently looking into another application so that I can remove this one.",4
132860,I've had this app for a long time now and only just recently I had a call from someone who tried to introduce me to a trading platform and had all my details from THIS app even though I have not given any consent for my data to be accessed. I am reporting the incident to multiple organisations.,6
132861,This is a well crafted investing app that has many views. It can tell you anything you need to know and it's clean. They did a great job as far coding abilities because it's smooth and packed with many features.,4

132871,It's been over two weeks since all of my external accounts (bank account/ CC accounts) were randomly erased... I still receive error messages every time I login to check.

free service!",4
132921,"Thanks for the ""improvement"" NOT. This app is a failure compared to Mint Bills. None of my billing accounts transferred over and I don't even see a way to add them. The entire app feels overly complicated and cluttered. Bills was brilliant this thing adds a bunch of pretty but useless garbage. A definite downgrade from Mint Bills. Intuit would be better off adding a budget tab to Mint Bills than adding bill pay to this hot mess. In summation, this app sucks. Update: reply to my review said give it a try... Obviously didn't read this review as I did give it a try. Now I'm trying Prism and looks a heck of a lot better than this or even Mint Bills. Intuit, you blew it.",0

133246,"I had some issues after the last update with finance tracking and reorganization, but I don't have as many problems with it now! I was really happy the team added back in the cents, rather than rounding it up to the nearest dollar.

133255,"Fluff articles are very apparent. Not a fan of baseless articles about companies. Speculation rather than informed, logical/analytical analysis should not be the focus of any news source. I find it tacktless and abhorrent that there aren't rigorous processes for content that could affect the price of stocks and manipulate retail investors away from potential investments due to poor journalism/factual data.",12
133256,"Every time when product team update the app it comes less user friendly . The prices don't updated in real time now. What they know is to tell you re install, never solve any problems . Incompetent Yahoo people. It's why Google is better than you .",5

133287,I have used Mint for years and it was great until about 6 months ago. I cannot get in to several of my accounts. On one it asks for my security question and even though I have changed it twice to make sure I have it right it still tells me the answer is wrong. I don't know if it is the bank causing the issue but it makes the app pretty much useless to me.,0

133291,As far as tips and general financial information or advice I guess Mint is fine. However they fall quite short as a budgeting app. The biggest downfall of Mint is their unwillingness to allow/add budgeting to the penny. I have had Mint for years waiting for them to add this. Many monthly bills are not even dollar amounts but when you enter in any amount with a decimal point and exact change Mint simply changes/rounds it to the nearest dollar. I have finally given up and deleted my account.,2
133292,works excellent now. happy with supports response,0

133783,"This app is almost perfect, it syncs quite well with all my accounts, even my RobinHood! It helps me keep track of budgets and spending trends, my bills. I am on it everyday, it has a learning curve but once you get it down it's a wierd day if I haven't opened this app to see what's going on with finances. The only thing I would suggest is being able to break down categories a little more in the trending tab. So I can see what I spent on beer, games etc. I wanna see my frivilous spending.",18
133784,Mint has replaced my carrying around a bank check register. I really like the paperless recordkeeping. Easy to search for past purchases for refunds/exchanges.  Such as finding a purchase date that led to finding the paper receipt of a microwave purchase more than a year and a half. This is a great app.,4

133800,"This is a fantastic app. However, its been crashing way too often after the recent update.",1
133801,Unless you live in North America. Perhaps it could consider removing the zip code requirement so that those of us living elsewhere on the planet could try it out. It shouldn't be an editor's pick until that happens.,0
133802,AWESOME APP. Does exactly what I need it to do. Thank you.,0

I love that everything is categorized and tracked and I don't have to manually categorize everything. Occasionally there's some weird misses but it seems to learn from my changes.

133821,Works great for what I use it for,0
133822,I love this app but it doesnt support other credit cards and pls allow users to review  cash flow for past months. Also enter or edit our own category and split cash withdrawals. Then it will be the perfect finance tools!,0
133823,I added this yesterday. I synced my bank accounts and by 430am this morning I got alert from my back that someone has been trying to gain access to my bank accounts. I really don't think it was a coincidence. Very fishy. I urge you not to sync ANY accounts.,0
133824,very useful,0
133825,Great app for consolidate view of all your accounts and budgets.,0
133826,"Absolutely garbage syncing across Intuit systems. I used and paid for TurboTax on PC several times before, and I was hoping to be able to seamlessly sign into Mint as well with the same information. However the app just outright refuses to let me log in, giving me a plain ""Unable to log in"" pop up. Both email and username attempts have failed miserably. Suffice to say, this has lowered my faith in Intuit for future money management services (including TurboTax). Stay away.",8
133827,Come on cnbc. Android phones have bigger screens than ipods/iphones. The android version of this app is just crap.,2
133828,Lots of wasted screen space and overall sub par.. There is a lack of a good finance app on Android for tracking multiple portfolios and noone seems to want to fill this need..,1

133836,"This app was working quite well for many years until recently. For some reason it will no longer connect to my credit union accounts. It says to verify the account and when I go through the steps to do that it seems to time out and I get a message saying that I didn't input the right information as my security code even though it was exactly the code that my credit union texted just seconds earlier. As soon as I get that error, my credit union then texts two more security codes. Very frustrating",16
133837,"Fast, to the point, immediate response.",0

133873,Good app for news but my stock prices seem to lag by a couple of days or more,0
133874,"The app is a great utility for me. I can take a quick glance at my stock get the latest finance news, look at the technicals us they have their own TA that you can review.",5
133875,"Great when it works. I was even considering subscribing to the laid version, but the app has to be told to update my brokerage accounts manually and the option is only available some of the time so if I make a few trades they won't show up on Yahoo until hours later which makes day trading very difficult with the app. The widgets are a really nice way to view all the stock I want to see right on my home screen, but they will randomly stop working until you remove the widget and replace it.",6
133876,Great for keeping track of your finances and monthly spending.,0
133877,"This looks like a great app to use but unfortunately this app doesn't carry my bank. Which is ""First Financial Credit Union"". It would be great if I could try this app but I can't even move forward without attaching a bank account first.",0

133889,"Decent tool to help manage your money. However: getting increasingly more spammy with notifications of which you can't opt out. Spotty synchronization with  accounts.

133903,why this app isn't supporting real me 2 pro device its very annoying to me. i like this app very much in my old phone i used to use it but not it not at all responding please fix that with an update,2
133904,Sometimes it has trouble syncing and staying connected to my bank accounts but I think that's more and issue with my bank. They recently made their ads and promotions section twice the size but the promotions are financial/investment related so I dont mind as much (vs ads for Homescapes or Merge magic or something asinine like that). Overall I really enjoy it. I wish you could delete budget categories so theres less to look through when sorting expenses.,0
133905,I absolutely love this app. Keeps me in the know with each one of my bills.,0

133918,"Sooooo annoying to delete the app if you don't want it. You have to log on to desk top, the instructions are not clear, you can't navigate the chat and work within the app so the conversation exits. (I got the app because I don't have time or the desire to sit at my desk top. I multitask. Customer service cannot delete the app for you like many other applicantions allow. It's annoying. I do not recommend.) Also there's no way to setup categories with desired amounts for spending. It just tracks",0
133919,Is there a version that works with UK banks etc?,0

Needs to partner with WeBull still, but otherwise does a great job about letting me break down each aspect of my financial life. Would strongly recommend to anyone looking to grow their wealth by preserving it.",1
133923,Great App. Very useful if you are a trader. There is room for improvement though. The news videos that play automatically consume a lot of data. It would be nice to have to press play if you want to watch the videos or a setting that determines the behaviour. It would be nice if the app could notify you of the price of a stock or comodity or currency pair of your chouce every few hours or so.,528

133949,Bug report: The time scale is off by one hour GMT on forex charts. The charts are showing 6 hours ahead of EST instead of 5.,4
133950,This app says that I pay for things twice. Like I pay for parking and it says that I paid for that same parking the same amount the next day. I check my accounts with my bank to make sure I wasn't getting charged twice and I wasn't.  So this app ends up telling me I'm over budget when I'm not. It doubles almost everything. It's very annoying when your trying to keep track of your money and it's not even the truth. And it keeps kicking me out of my account and I occasionally have to re sign in. Super annoyin,1

133962,"I appreciate having all of my finances in one spot! I especially appreciate the budgeting feature, as it gives me a better idea of the areas I'm spending the most and what I can cut back on.

134028,"The main header stock price never updates with the side bar price updates, then freezes. Will delete from phone and try again next month. Not sure if the android update caused this or the program itself. I get ""stopped working"" notifications 20-30 times per day over the last several weeks. I report the issues to Google and have not received any feedback. Best program I've used until these issues surfaced. They fixed the mobile app!!!",7
134029,This app definitely puts EVERYTHING into perspective. We have a lot of spending habits to change and this app is great for seeing where it all goes. If it came with free or reduced budgeting consultation that'd be great!,1
134030,Is it possible to get alert/notification of few stocks,0
134031,I was surprised to find that I was charged a service fee for the fee app. I'm not sure why but it was pretty disappointing.,0

134040,Best app out to keep your finances in check,0
134041,more reliable on desktop app. app is fine but sucks data so hard. Background processes abuse android power settings. It is there; but usually not useful since they added in more advertisements that take up 50% of the screen As a long time mint user... i hate this but it works so.

134060,I liked it until PRWCX and others no longer show yearly gains or losses. Been like this few months now.,0
134061,Excellent app. Keeps me updated with all announcements from the developed world. Downside is they should include EM and FM as well.,0
134062,I hate the new update. The old format was easy to use and didn't have a giant ad in the middle of the first page. Everything used to be 1 click away and now you have to scroll multiple times to get to the page you want and there are ads on half the scroll pages before I even get to the page I want. This is awful and made it incredibly difficult to use and I used this daily. I would rather open it on my browser than use the app with the new update.,4

134085,"Does what it was design for but pretty annoying that it freezes constantly (does not react to touch, scroll or back)",1
134086,It does that thing.,0
134087,Overall experience is great. Fantastic app to keep track of your finances in one place. Few bank connections have problem with refreshing data. For those banks I had to delete and then add accounts back again. Not sure if it is a problem with the Mint service or the bank itself. I highly recommend this app and service.,0

134099,"The Mint app made it infinitely easier for me to stick with a plan for obtaining financial security. I love the simple financial overviews, the budgeting tool, and the fact that monitoring my credit score isn't a hassle.

134134,so just like everyone else says the new update made the UI so much more difficult to use. none of my information is even on the main screen anymore and it just tells me to link accounts. this app which I have recommended has rendered itself useless to me and has become too difficult to use.,2

I like the app but I can't help but wonder how much I will be paying next year, year after that, etc. This year we have ~15% 'inflation'. Hope the issue is addressed. I like the app but I won't be paying for such increases if they continue especially since the app is not cheap and there is no lifetime license. Thanks.",1

134553,I have to give one star due to the absurd price that Yahoo wants to charge for the premium version... I really can't envisage how the extra features and analysis provided would justify the cost... No wonder Yahoo as a company has faded into obscurity and it smacks of desperation that the only way Yahoo's management team can think of to try and bolster or grow revenue is to charge what other applications provide for free or for a much lower cost... Yahoo will soon be a relic of the tech past...,19

It's a great way to keep track of your finances without having to log into your online bank/credit card accounts individually. Please note that the app doesn't let you actually make any transactions with your accounts--this is a good thing, because you don't want someone to have that kind of access if your phone ever gets stolen! Overall, this is a very useful app for me.",10

134584,"Updating my review based on the new UI design. Overall, much nicer than the one they tried and reverted a couple years ago. They must have missed the key complaint everyone had though... The budget should be front and center right when you open the app. It's a budgeting app where you have to tap extra to actually see your budget. Again better than the first attempt where you had to tap a bunch but still not as good as what was originally there where the budget was the first thing you saw.",36

134596,"Provides decent functionality, but I like to add a tag to each transaction after I view it. This app won't let me filter searches by the presence, or more importantly absence, of a tag. Mint, please add that feature!  Edit: Mint responded indicating that searching by tag is possible. Unlike the website where you can search for a tag named 'cleared' with tag:cleared, you simply search for cleared.  That's great, but as Mint does not offer a way to reconcile or otherwise mark a transaction as viewed, I really need a way to search for all transactions that do not have the tag that I add once I've viewed a transaction. I would love to find out that this is possible in the app, and not just on the website.",0

Well, now I can at least use it.  *Additional notes*  The app asks me to link other accounts on weeks where I don't end up spending any money.

Do you honestly think that if I had the money to pay the whole thing, I wouldn't do it? It's incredibly annoying and over complicates something that was very useful.

Then after an app update, every time I open one  specific account to view the details, the app crashes with an error message saying ""Unfortunately Yahoo Finance has stopped working"". No explanation. It just closes. I have sent several reports, but still the app continues to crash. Other than the recurring crashes I like the app as I said in my earlier review below.  EARLIER REVIEW.  The app provides up to date info on all my holdings and the market in general. It does everything I want in a clear and concise way.

For example, income is paid monthly on the 15th of every month. Therefore a budgeted month from say Aug 15th through Sep 15th would be much more favorable. This doesn't feel like a complicated fix.

Mint support simply bounces tickets around with some nonsense requests, ie. send us a picture of this or of that, without actually fixing anything.

136192,"Majority of the good reviews are for an older version. Not this one. I used mint bills for a long time and it was great. This is awful. It keeps telling me that I need to update my info.

And I can't just click and pay bills like I used to. Also, I have to go back to remembering, because... No reminders. Now I need to find a replacement app. And it has locked me out of several accounts. I had to call and talk to the companies to verify it was me and get my account unlocked. I'm an sadly deleting it.",17

136205,"I wish this app worked. As of right now, Mint double post all of my transactions, so none of its records are correct regarding my income or spending. It also does not give you the option to delete these double posted transactions. Also, every month I have to re-enter Bill's I had previously entered and marked as monthly occurring payments.

I used to love it for its simplicity.  Now there seems to be way too much going on. Having said that, I still love mint. I have used it since it was called Pageonce. It's a great app and it would be hard to live without it....which is why, in a way, that I feel stuck with the new design. I hope Intuit improves that.",4

136219,Can't seem to dismiss alerts. Clicking on things that I would expect to give me more info (based on the iOS app) does nothing. Also can't seem to get the widget to work as I would expect it to - i get a partial view of the transaction screen (as in half the word and half of the first transaction name) instead of a quick overview of relevant info.,23

What, some terrorist has been making deposits into these accounts which, by the way, were closed years ago.  But of course Mint somehow magically manages to get my balances as of four days ago, still showing a $1300+ balance, again on an account closed years ago.  (Bank of America closed every branch in this region and sold the accounts to Arvest Bank; that's why those accounts were closed.)  I remember spending hours trying to resolve some ridiculous statement I would receive from Mint.  Eventually I learned to ignore Mint to the point I never bothered to close my account.  Why write a review now?  Mint has started spamming me again.  Dear Mint, you were better off when you were not on my radar.",0

136282,Still not there. I tried this service/app a while back and quit because it didn't list all the accounts that I have. Years later I try again at the heavy recommendation of my mortgage provider (who I believe owns it now) and again find it pretty useless because it doesn't have all the accounts I have. I'm not talking about some rare bank from an obscure place. I'm talking about Hulu - they don't have it for bill info. Disney+ - they don't have it.,8

136327,I would suggest the following.  1. More options for the budget like the website,0
136328,I dislike TurboTax but this is okay TurboTax always sends in an incomplete return and forces you to get the plus version. Although this application seems to come in handy so.. if you could build more applications such as this which gather personal financial data and I truly help people that would be great as opposed to ripping them with tax software that you claim is free.,1

I can be in the app in the morning, go through and ""update"" at least four of my banks' info (meaning I have to sign in all over again) and then see the refreshed balances. Then when I go back in the afternoon to remind myself of a certain balance, the app is requiring me to repeat it all over again.

Even worse, at random I would get asked to provide account numbers for already setup bills just to pay a bill!!! Or asked for billing address on the paper bill before proceeding with a payment ?! What's the point then of this app if I have to go every now and then to my bill issuers website to get this info??? Matter as well just pay my bill there and be done with it.  I don't even have to mention the bills that you can't pay but only mark as paid!!! Or bills that the app don't recognize as financial or service providers.",0

136674,I like the other version better. I like to see each credit card and the balance and how much I had to pay monthly for it. I dont like this new version. I dont want a summary of what I owe. Since I'm not making one payment. I'm making multiple payments. I use to see how much I had to pay monthly and this would help in deciding where I would pay a little bit more.

I was worried that I was going to have to find another budgeting app, but thankfully we're back to the app we all know and love!  In the future, I'd recommend releasing a change like that in a beta app. I noticed one isn't even available for Mint. It could have saved a lot of frustration if you just rolled that out to beta users and received a lot of negative feedback from that. Nonetheless, you still listened to the users which is important.  This is definitely the best budgeting and finance app with how much control you have over transactions, the order in which you see your finances, notes, etc. I live and breathe by my Mint budget.

Furthermore, the following ""pages"" simply don't work and show blatantly incorrect information:  --The ""budget"" screen shows the wrong information on the ""you have $XYZ left"" statement.  When you actually look at the dedicated budget screen, it shows the correct amount.  --The spending screen shows the wrong amount for what you've spent last month.  For some reason it thinks I spent zero dollars last month.  -- The income shown on the cash flow page is just wrong and does not match what is shown when you actually look at the dedicated breakdown of spending screen.

I've tried my best, but what a disaster. I ended up paying a $513 bill twice because Mint didn't think I needed to pay anything and it wasn't clear how to force a payment.

136996,Somewhat useless compared to the website.  I wish they would ad some charts.,0
136997,Terrible performance even with Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra on full 5G signal. Quotes and screen updates often don't refresh properly.,3
136998,"This is a great way to keep organized. If it listed pending transactions, I would give it a 5. When using this as a way to keep track of spending in place of looking at account, it can be misleading about how much money is left in the budget.",1

137003,Love the app. One thing I noticed when switching from online to app .. sometimes it wiped out my portofio shares information. Hope you can add additional mode and layout option - more compact so more stocks can be watched/viewed at the glance.. thank you,0
137004,"Works well. Updates quite often. I like that it aggregates news stories relevant to your stock selections.   The only drawback is that on the price plot, there isn't a marker ON the plot that indicates the previous close value. It's just a design that I would like incorporated for visual convenience. Granted, it makes up for that with a color coded plot. Red for a stock price that's lower than precious close, and green for higher.",0
137005,Good learning ideas.i have learned lot and it is useful to trade.,0
137006,Love the app but would be great if there is an ad free version even if it's paid. Seeing those ads in the middle of financial data is a bit troublesome and confusing.,0
137007,"New user interface is terrible. Way too ""busy"". Ads and credit card offers and lots of other useless information that keeps me from seeing what I need. Frankly this app is now so clunky and confusing I may switch to something else. The old user interface was great and broke down my accounts and budgets so I could understand them clearly. Change it back!",25

137085,Like the app but it runs very slow on the note4. What is it doing in the background? Downloading ads? Crypto mining? Even when using Wifi connection it is constantly using data even when I'm reading an article/post when no live quotes are needed.,3
137086,"Not half bad. Gives me a fair overview of the day. Yahoo marketing needs to reevaluate the necessity of ad intrusion though. The present method is detrimental to both the app and the advertiser.  More, in these cases, is definitely not better.",4

137088,"this app is great to track credit card usage, score, and your money in the bank.

(1X) Suggestion: Stock chart indicators have a name label and most the time it blocks the chart information, hope future information could allow to hide it with a small icon.

137302,Mint does a great job of allowing me to know the balance of my checking account by downloading my checking purchases from my bank and then allowing me to add in expenses via the website that will clear the checking account.

137328,"Good but 2 issues for me. I open the app to add a transaction, but the app downloads new data and forces me to the home screen while doing so, canceling the transaction. So I sit there for ~10 sec before trying again. Infuriating. And let me search and list ALL results for a search term instead of needing to pick a very specific result the app suggests in the search box.",21
137329,Keeps you up to date on the market and notified of the events of the day.  If you have watch lists on your PC   they follow you on your phone.,3
137330,This app has made staying on top of our finances so much easier. In just the little time I've been using it I already see a difference in how we spend. The only thing I wish I could do would be to edit or set my budgets for future months without disturbing the current month.

137355,"Recently I tried installing this app and creating an account but it flagged me because of my last name and would not let me continue past the login screen.

The auto budgets created for me at the beginning are way, way off in every department.

There is especially difficulty with watch-list pages. I am considering finding a fully functioning from a competing developer.

You could have a part of the app that proactively asks the user questions about which category the transaction should be in, and it could work as a good machine learning model. The ads and offers section of this app are unhelpful, and obnoxiously placed. The income they get from the ads doesn't justify the quality of this app.",6

I can't reply to your reply on google play but if you want to work through this contact me at [removed after no contact for a month] and I can provide more information.  Btw, I orignally tried to screenshot the error so I could pass it along and the app blocks all screenshots (which is really stupid IMO, if someone wants to capture that data they'll do it) I'm sure it's some business requirement but I'd argue to remove it if you have that ability (I'm a developer too, I know what it's like)  Also, if you crash instead of popping up a modal with those exceptions then it will prompt the user if they'd like to submit a error report to you in which you'll actually get the stack trace without the need for this work around communication",3

However, over those 5 years, there has been little to no improvement for both the Android app and web app. It hasn't become easier to use and I can't do much more than what I could do 5 years ago.

Just bring back the old UI, and give an option to sort the list. Also, if you could add market cap into the list preview on home page, such as one tap - change in percent, 2nd tap - change in $, 3rd tap - current market cap.",34

137732,"I spent a couple hours putting all my stocks in, the prices, the dates. The app just deleted everything. Do not waste your valuable time on this.",0
137733,Coming from version 6: Too many taps to get info. Text is WAY to big with too much whitespace which requires the need to scroll down a lot. Information is not easily visible at a glance. Full screen notice when launched at times. TIHI!,2
137734,It would be even more nicer to sync watchlist with earnings report so that I don't have to manually search & set reminder,0
137735,"It's missing some functionality for joint accounts and couples in the app, but generally very satisfactory for managing an account on your telephone.",0
137736,It won't let me sign into my bank account. Keeps telling me my password expired when it hasn't. I logged in on my computer and my phone with the same password and it worked. Looking forward to using this app but it's getting uninstalled....oh well,0
137737,can you add a dividend tab like what seeking alpha has with div. history information etc. then this would become a 5 star finance app!,0
137738,"Can't get tmobile to connect anymore? password and number are all correct. also, I've missed some bills because they are not updating for this month. it shows everything paid for June, but hasn't put my recurring July bills up. frustrating. I switched to a different app!🤬",0
137739,Charting is the most primitive i have ever see.  Pathetic for a leading financial news agency.,1
137740,"Seriously, I got $100 back so far (4 months) AND its saves all your receipts in case you need to return something. I recommend it to everyone and I never do that.",0
137741,Hard to add your actual budget to it. Takes forever to manually put in everything and it doesn't load properly. And I can't even delete my bank info on here it tells me to try again later. Doesn't function well with android it seems,0

137756,Keep asking me to turn the Adblock off is annoying,0
137757,I don't mind it. I haven't found one that shows my bank statement breakdown this nicely. I wish there were more Canadian items to add (national student loans) the ability to link to Equifax and Transunion would be nice.... Faster updating of transactions would be nice (usually updates late night even when I try to force it - my bank shows thi g's posted on my acc right away though),2

137807,very good application,0
137808,"Overall it's a great app. Easily one of the better financial apps out there and I love how it tracks and syncs with my bank. Most other apps can't do that. My only critique would be a budgeting calendar would be nice. If there is one, I haven't found it yet.",0

137824,"First impression very friendly but so deceived when I realise that the CHART tool has only the 1 DAY option working... the most important ""visualizing"" tool to represent and understand any and every written descriptions , opinions and analysis' of which ever market price history....a SNAPCHART tool ;-) sorry can't give more than 2.3 Stars",0

137843,I've been using this app for a while and Yahoo has made massive improvement over the last few yrs. Highly recommend if you use Yahoo mail or Services.,0

137845,It says I need to go to my bank to update my info but every time I log on through mint it doesnt update. It just keeps saying your bank beeds you. I really liked this app at first it and if I can get this problem fixed ill change my rating.,0

137856,"The app functionality is good, but it really annoys me to that it saves and 
repopulates your username after you log out (and no, it's not convenient to 
have to clear app data each time I use it!). So what, if someone steals my 
phone, all they have to do is hack my password to get access to all my 
finances? For a financial app that prides itself on security, this is very 
poor in my opinion, especially when people have a multitude of emails they 
can use as username. Congratulations on handing a would-be attacker 50% of 
the authentication battle. Boo.",0
137857,just another liberal trump hating app. if you try to write anything positive about the president it goes to review and wont get posted but only the negative trump stuff will if you try to have an debut on the issues people just call you racist so it's just like every news channel suck really enjoy this app but just all the hate the world has is toxic and annoying. if your a Republican or even a moderate dem DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP CAUSE YOU'LL JUST BEA RACIST.,2

137865,The app is really great for looking up stocks and keeping track of a watch list. The ads in the article sections are a bit much though. My biggest gripe is that the preview charts have been broken and displaying incorrect data for a month now. I've reinstalled twice but they're still not working. Please fix this.,15

137877,"Very useful application,",0
137878,I find it fast and gives me what I want.,0
137879,"After 45 minutes of waiting, retrying my account info, and waiting some more I have given up on this app. I use PNC and apparently having security questions as part of the security measures is too much for Mint to handle. I just keep getting an error message saying I need to edit my account info even though it's correct. Wouldn't recommend this if you bank at PNC or have security questions attached to your bank account sign in.",0
137880,"Since new update tickers can only see 1 letter in watchlists and everything crashes all the time last two updates make app unusable, especially with latest update, with fix app still super buggy and keeps crashing",3

137892,It makes my life easier,0
137893,Won't sync checking accounts.  Only does it when it feels like it.  Keeps telling me my bank account number changed and it didn't.  I re-enter the same login credentials and it works for a day then same issue again.  Contacted customer service and they don't have a solution.  Will have to delete if it can't be fixed.  I can't use it if it won't sync... Love the app when it works.... But won't wait much longer for a fix.,7
137894,"The only thing missing is the ability to enter a captcha for one of my banks, so I can't update that account from this app unfortunately. Otherwise, this is incredibly useful!",0

137905,Sounds like a great app. Would like to logon without forceclosing,0
137906,They removed budgets for the past months from the app with the latest update. This was the main tool to analyze your spending. So now essentially this app is useless,1
137907,"This app was 5 stars up until it keeps asking me to update account with security questions, yet doesn't ask them. Fix this for 5 star rating.",0

137913,I am a regular user of investing.ca for some years. I am grateful that website and app both are free. This is a great support for people like me who are just starting investing. Others are charging tons of money for same and forcing to subscribe. The news and analysis contents are updated very fast and they are short and to the point. Overall it is a good resource for investing.,17

137924,Remember the first rule of financial independence : know thy cash flow. Mint makes it easy to do that. This app is evolving to handle more crazy categorizing and that is good.,0
137925,What a great app. It gives me the datas that I want when I want them and how I want it.,3
137926,"Reading lots of negative comments. I had some persistent login issues and felt similar frustration, back and forth with tech.

News can be of a more American/continental nature whereas my interest lies in purely UK products.,0
137932,updated my text from the april update. The app was reverted back to the old user interface and I like it much better. one thing I noticed from another app that I used the past couple months that would like to see... personal Capital had a great way to show past months cash flow compared to current month. I would love to see this feature added,11
137933,So many glitches and won't sign me into my account. Had to change my password so many times just to still not be able to sign into my account. Deleted the app and will soon be deleting my account. I've had this account for 2 years by the way!!! Continuous glitches for 2 years!,0

137978,"If you're looking for a budgeting app that lets you enter multiple individual items per category for tight tracking, avoid this. If you budget with bulk amounts in categories, then this is the app for you. Easy to add accounts but the AI is hit or miss. Who knew beverages at 7-ELEVEN were a TV expense?

138155,Liked the app except it doesn't let you customize the number of decimals like other apps do. Showing 4-5 decimals is confusing and honestly annoying. I've switched to another app that shows only 2 decimals. I guess they have developers with more common sense.,0
138156,"I get paid biweekly. So, every two weeks and am forced to do my budget by hand because no app has the option of adjusting the dates that the budget should restart or be remade.

138165,"I absolutely LOVE this app. After using paper and spreadsheets to track expenses for a few years, this app makes it much easier to not only track expenses but also to set up a realistic budget (and see my current progress.) I was also able to create a goal of an emergency fund and view progress. It also allows me to easily view upcoming bills, see my back account, credit card, car loan and investment account balances. I was worried about security, but it even helped me notice a fraudulent charge on a credit card more quickly.  (Tip: Pay attention to card readers at gas station pumps.) The only thing I find annoying is that a few accounts require that I verify my account via text or email before it will update account information. And at first I couldn't figure out how to add one of my bank accounts but found out I needed to set it to ""read only"" privileges. This app makes managing my money and saving for retirement much easier!!",2

138173,"The ""income"" category doesn't appear in your budget list like it does on the desktop version. As far as I can tell, there is no easy way to see your income and spending together. Also the app still sends you notifications even after you've turned them all off.",1
138174,Mint has completely changed the way my family manages our finances. This app seamlessly places all of our accounts in one place so that we can balance or monthly budgets and save for future expenditures. Thank you Intuit for creating such a useful app.,0

138181,Nice app for investors,0
138182,"Best app I've found for my limited purposes. I use the free version to track indices and a few stocks as well as to check the occasional news story. Most important part for me is the widget that lets me monitor a list of symbols on my home screen without having to fire up the app. (Though occasionally the widget doesn't seem to want to refresh without a nudge.) The level of advertising is perfectly acceptable to keep the product free, though as some others have noted, there seem to be more scammy/junk ads appearing these days. That probably has more to do with their ad network provider than with the app. The articles are sometimes interesting and useful--just avoid the comment streams, which are populated by nothing but trolls and zealots both left and right--nothing useful there. Would be great if the company offered a lower-price paid version that removed ads and didn't offer as many of the advanced features. For my purposes, $60/year is too steep, but I'd definitely pay $20.",150

138204,the new update is not user-friendly. Feels more like they are trying to sell me credit cards than they are trying to show me my data in a useful way. I can't figure out how to actually use this thing. I just want to know what my spending income Trends are. and when you view the information by category you have to click them to view them. This is bad usability because I have massive thumbs,3

138218,Good app to have,0
138219,"I like this app, but I'm having constant problems logging in. The app won't let me log in under my user ID, but forces me to use my email address, and once I'm in, all of my account info is gone as if I've started a whole new account. Syncing everything was already a pain, but once it was done, I was happy with it. Now, a few days later, and its all gone. If this is how it's going to be, I won't keep my account, and I wouldn't recommend anyone else to.",0
138220,"Useful app, I use it daily to keep an eye on exchange rates and what is going on financially.",0
138221,Excellent usability!,0
138222,Great apps.,0
138223,Good app that could be great. Big help to keep track of my spending and maintain a budget. Many of the accounts that I have set up through this app still have to be logged into before they update. Kind of annoying having to log in to my mint account & my debit card account after each use in order to get my available balance updated,2
138224,"I absolutely loved Mint Bills and was skeptical when I had to reenter and transition all of my accounts to regular Mint. This app in theory has a lot of the same functionality and adds being able to track budgets better. However, this app is TERRIBLE at keeping you logged into accounts. At least once a week I have to reenter a password for an account even though the password/login information has NOT changed. Every account was working ~1 week ago. Today 4 of my accounts are asking for updated logins and one account was deleted entirely. It's VERY frustrating to have to continually check the app to be sure nothing has been removed and reenter the same login information. If it were more reliable like Mint Bills was in the past, I would definitely give it 5 stars. App bugs make it a solid 3.",0
138225,Love this app. Pretty accurate on gold commodity and gain almost 500 pips in a single trade everyday. It's very useful and recommended app for trader.,0

138227,It's 90% correct on analysis,0
138228,"I used to love this app, but it just keeps getting worse. The latest update adds the summary widget that still takes up half a screen of blank space and balances are a long way out of date. I have to check directly with my bank which makes this app kinda useless.",2
138229,It's nice to have everything in a simple to look up app. The only downside is that it doesn't reflect my available balance after pending transactions. It probably has something to do with the bank's integration.,0
138230,This is good for freshers,0
138231,I am unable to open this app on my tablet or smartphone. I love this app when it works.,0

138237,"Very quickly syncs with your accounts.  Sets budgets based on previous history.  Very easy to use interface. Does have a few screen formatting issues and the settings/logout menu is not functioning on the nexus 7.  Just after a quick use and setup, I plan to use this app going forward.",0

138260,It's nice. Wait on second thought there are way too many issues. Good for high school students managing their piggy bank. With all the money earned from subscription at least fix the application. Sheesh! Talk about a get rich quick scheme.,0
138261,"I use Robinhood to invest (along with other brokerages, which are supported by Mint) but either Robinhood doesn't have an API for apps such as Mint to use, or Mint is yet to add Robinhood to their list of supported accounts. Adding support for Robinhood would be a game changer for me as it would, I'm sure, for the many people flocking to Robinhood for their zero commission trading. I'd love to finally have ALL my finances managed from one place :)",0

138278,I like this app so far. I've been using it for about a week. I would have given this five stars but my USAA account can't seem to stay authenticated so it keeps prompting me to fix the problem. The other thing that I didn't like was all of alerts for the first month teeming me that everything I did was unusual spending. Aside from those two I like the app and will probably keep using it.,0

138280,Nice well done,0

138368,"a wonderful app for looking at all your accounts at once, making and tracking budgets, and overall financial trends. It is not a ""real time"" look at all your accounts but it does show balances within a day of actual. That is why it does not get 5 stars.",1

Lots of useful information right when you log in is now separated into different pages. Please bring back the old interface with a big summary at log in. The new update is a backward step in actual usability. Had it at 2 stars and after using the new update more decreased it to 1 star. Might stop using the app now. So disappointed in Mint.,41

138400,"I enjoy the app, but can't trust some of the numbers, which is crucial. e.g VRNO market cap is actually about 40% higher than what yahoo calculates, making the PE look better than it really is.

138401,"I've been using Mint for a couple year now... the App has been great for me. Occasionally the accounts need to be fixed, which means reentering your credentials, to keep the accounts updating properly. It's annoying to do, but a necessary part of aggregation.

I'm financially savvy having been an advisor, but for those who don't know, the App gives good recommendations.",0

138424,Keeps all your finance in one spot. Keep tract of everything in one look,0
138425,The budget was very ridged. I was not able to add custom categories into budget. That really turned me off this app. I also noticed that it was very cluttered on the home screen with too much info and stupid articles. It is not very user friendly. The app should open up a budget when you launch and everything else should be accessible in a drop down menu or something. Very poorly designed. I would stray clear of this app.,0
138426,Works for me.,0
138427,A very good tool....keep it up...keep improvising wherever you can..gr8,0
138428,If it can show scheduled upcoming  payments too as soon as they show up in my bank account would be 5 stars.,3

138437,There is no way to report a bug anyhwhere so I'll post it here hoping it gets seen. The mobile app is losing all graph data except net worth and spend. The only way to recover it is to restart the app multiple times or to clear the apps's cache.,0

138441,"Saved me money the very first day I started using it. Only one thing keeping this app from getting five stars, and that is it doesn't sync in real time with a few credit cards. It takes a few days even after the credit posts on the card which in its self usually takes a couple days.",0

138463,"The app lacks heavily in comparison to the website. In app, you cannot change name of transaction, split transaction into multiple budgets, or create new budget.

138524,"I've been using this app for ~8 years, with little to no complaints. There's a recent update that now causes ALL my transactions to duplicate!!! ***--->MINT PLEASE FIX<----*** Additionally, I wish I could add another label for all my categories as Fixed vs Variable costs.

138556,"Did not and will not trust my banking on a third party app. Every single Q&A said you can use the app without linking your banking. So I signed up and it turns out that's definitely not true. Will not allow you to move forward without linking an account. So I tried deleting the account and sure enough! Does not allow you!! Every time I click ""delete my mint account"" it just redirects you to their Intuit page that has no option for deleting. Glad I did not trust this app. So sketchy.",2

138598,As long as the glitches continue to be worked out its a good app. I will change to Great App if all is good in my second year. Why?

138847,"I like this app, I do. However, there is one suggestion that I have been making since I first downloaded it. It is maddening that every month, I go to uncategorized transactions and have to input the same transaction over and over again.    I understand the occasional transaction that has never been categorized before, but for recurring transactions, if I categorize the transaction, it should save the transaction category every time that transaction appears.   The transaction details haven't changed, and it would be good to be able to accurately track my spending without first going through this process every month, and week, in some instances.",9

I say ""stuck"" I meant that the refresh button goes on an infinite loop and

Now Mint: - shows and counts twice purchases that my wife did with my account supplementary card; - purchases on my card (Bluecash main or supplementary) show as if my wife did it with her card (Everyday), which is wrong.

139283,"What happened to Mint?  How can the old Mint Bills work perfectly for years, and now they discontinued that app and combined it with this version of Mint that is constantly broken.  Every other day I have a new account that won't sync in Mint, it tells me I have incorrect login info when I dont, and it fails to update.

139350,Easy to use. I'm rebuilding credit and Mint is helping by keeping me informed of my credit score.,0
139351,Not worth the effort to set up. It does not stay linked to account so you have to log into multiple accounts every time to get it to keep and accurate record and accounting there's no way to account for cash on hand or income or accounts receivable without creating a property account.  Which still doesn't count towards cash flow on the bill section. Usaa won't stay connected. You can not easliy edit the property accounts to account for changes you have to delete and create new. Took an extremely long time to set up for very little results. I was exceptionally disappointed.,0

Then ""Bills"" shows your bills and your cc and loans again.  Now it has problems with keeping your accounts logged in.  I find myself having to update my logins for my cc or other stuff.  It's constantly asking me to enter my PayPal account number, which I have tried logging into the PP app, but it doesn't show that on the app.  So I have to get home to check and this totally defeats the purpose of the ""mobile"" convenience of having everything in one place.

139472,"Used this app for years. Times up, time to give us what we need for a solid budgeting app. Adding cash transactions more easily, goals need to have more options not just paying back credit or rasing a score!!!!

139481,"For some reason the 'Net Income' section on the app doesn't include a transaction catorigized as a 'Paycheck' to be part of my income, so I always appear to be in the red. However, the same 'Net Income' calculation is done correctly on the website.  Also, I've been using Mint for several years and have quite a few accounts that I've marked as 'Closed'. These accounts are hidden on the website, but with one of the latest app updates all of these 'Closed' accounts are now being displayed on my mobile device.",0

139485,This is the best app I ever had.,0
139486,"Disappointed. The redesign is fine. Not my personal preference for how things are organized but I understand they have to monetize with ads. I'm disappointed in the loss of features compared to the previous build. Notably, I am no longer able to bulk recategorize transactions from the same source while in the app. I don't see a reason to use transactions if i can't do that. I'm not trying to balance a checkbook here, I'm trying to correctly assign transactions to ensure I'm following my budget.",53
139487,"I've been using Mint for a number of years, with my fingerprint. And periodically, it'll reset itself and I have to log in with my password (which I no longer remember, because I use my fingerprint.) So I have to reset my password, again. And then it asks, again, if I want to enable fingerprint. If I could just keep using my fingerprint and stop with the periodic, unannounced resets, it would help tremendously (and I would give a higher rating).",2

139505,Great application to keep track of all bills and other personal finances. One thing I do wish would improve and the reason for leaving off 1 star is improving the connection to the various merchants. To many times does the connection to certain accounts does not work . I'm not sure where the issue lies but if that could be improved then this would be a 5 star app. I still greatly recommend it.,4

139527,This app sucked. I was excited to try it but it was never able to log me into Credit Card websites after multiple attempts on both the app and website. The credit card company is one listed in their selection screen so how could it not work on either computer or phone? Wasted about 2 hours trying and said screw it.,0

139585,"This is a great little program to see how much you're spending on how much of it goes where. You can set alerts when you've spent too much on a certain type of item (such as hobbies or food). It's important to note that this program only lets you monitor your accounts. It does not give you the ability to perform ANY actions with your account such as paying bills, depositing, changing account info, or transferring funds, which is actually a good thing in terms of security.  It's really good for people who want to check their balances on their mobile device but are too afraid to install a bank/credit card app to check their balance because they're afraid their information or money might get stolen.",1

one. The web allows several more modifications while the app is more an 
overview for on the go. I had some issues for a while syncing with CIBC but 
its better now. I guess what I would like is an option to make reoccurring 
and one time budgets in the same category. Dinning out might increase one 
month for a birthday or anniversary, but I don't want to make a whole new 
category for it. Overall the app meets my needs without being overly 
complicated like other apps. It gives what I need, and I can go on the 
computer as well to see more details.",3

139598,Use it all the time. Would be nice to have spending by tome /category graphs like in desktop HTML version.,0
139599,I used to like this app very much. Not any more because it cannot sync with all institutions and it does not even accept any uploads from the users where they cannot sync anymore. When updates are made it is useless to app users saying improving app without mentioning what type of bugs are being fixed !!,2
139600,Takes forever to update transactions. Last update has made this app my least favorite. Don't trust or like any of the other apps out there. So please fix this. Not sync accounts anymore like use too. Least favorite app.,4
139601,Great app sometimes refreshes to long but whatever still works. Buttsex,1
139602,The fluid design and the watchlist funds tracking on the front page makes this app even more easier to use at a glance. I like the interoperability with the website based portal and this heads up app.,0

It shows how much debt to income you have, any alerts, how much is in each account and pending transactions. However it doesn't show the one thing I would expect which is your budget. If there is a way to show budget information for Android please let me know.",5

139612,Frustrating to use as every time I try to use this app I would have to reauthenticate/re-verify my bank. It was great to have a widget to see balances (when it worked). For a product from a well known financial company I would expect more.,0

139717,"Loaded it up. Tried connecting my bank, looked at the ""connecting"" screen for 20 minutes. Restarted the app, tried again, same result. Waste of my time.",0
139718,What happens with app,0
139719,stock price alerts is not working properly! Update: The app was recently updated to fix bugs - testing it out. This app deserves good rating as developers care about your app experience.,5
139720,Loved the old app. The new one is horrible. I can't add all the accounts I had on my old one.,0
139721,"I'd have no clue where my cash leaks were if it wasn't for this app. Great interface, great design, easy to use, just wish we could create categories on mobile and create a feature for cash on hand.",11
139722,"Simpky super, relavant news, coustmise",0
139723,"I tried to use this app since the WeBull app doesn't support IDX quotes anymore, but really this app is seriously abysmal. Creating watchlist/holdings barely works, since newly created portfolio won't show up and when it does, it'll disappear instantly. I can't even add any positions into portfolio, the app keep saying the update failed every time even though my internet works fine. Very disappointing first impression honestly.",15
139724,"Clear, concise and u know where you stand at all times. Keep it up.",0
139725,The new sync setup with some credit cards really limits the real time budgeting gains of this app. Will probably seek alternatives to mint if it doesn't get better.,2
139726,I often had a hard time keeping track of all my money and bills.  This program helped me know exactly how much money I have and how much I owe.  It let me know when all my bills are due.  It even recommend ways to save or make money via reward credit cards.  I have told all my friends and we all use it.,0
139727,Outstanding,0
139728,Tried uninstall re install no luck. Doesn't communicate with my credit union very well either. Please fix,0
139729,The app is good. One of the most important features that I miss in it is the option to force-refresh individual accounts. Some accounts just don't refresh twice within a 24 hours window when trying to refresh all accounts.,0
139730,"I rated 5 🌟 because I have confident from people comment, and I need to know the minimum amount for starting trading",0
139731,App looks good. But when I sign into my bank it automatically syncs not just my personal accounts it mixes in my business account to. There is no way to delete my business accounts from my personal info. OK thanks that helped! I tried it again and seems good so far.,2
139732,App not working,0
139733,The mobile app does not sync with the desktop version so data not always accurate. Setup and some other functionality is easier in the desktop version. DEFINITELY a 5-star app IF the syncing worked to increase mobile app efficiency/usefulness.,1
139734,It would be more helpful if expenses linked to user splitwise app ....,1
139735,"This app sucks. It was way better add mint bills.  This one shows all my transactions so it gets very confusing when I'm trying to balance my checking account and it shows all my credit card transactions in the same place.  Also,impossible to manage my credit card accounts now.  I can't see the available balance payment due or due date in one location.  Must go through several screens and the information isn't correct.  It does my checking account balance as available credit card balance.  So disappointed. I really loved it before this new version.",0

139749,"Recently Mint has not been rolling over my bills to the next month.  It just says, ""Congratulations, you have no bills!""  Of course I wish that were true, but alas it is not.

139750,"Go back to mint bills. Too much going on with this app. Simplicity was nice, this isn't and most useful stuff is now left out like bill pay and view of due dates for accounts etc. I don't understand the change from mint bills? Bummer.",3

139799,Updated Review. Still 1 Star. It's a great app but every other month will make one or more of your current accounts inactive. Trying to reconnect them is a pain and doesn't work. So you'll always have 1 or 2 accounts deactivated without consent and then have to try reconnecting them for a few weeks until it's back to normal. By the time the problem account is back another one is deactivated.... it's such a hassle. PLEASE PLEASE FIX - been asking for this bug to be solved for mooooonths now.,1

139956,"interface is simple and easy to navigate. Wish there were more options like the ability to turn off ""add accounts"" button or have only one of your account balances appear in the widget. The widgets are weird and usually load as ""summary"" rather than whatever you have it set as. The app tracks deductions from your account just fine but after depositing a check my balance still won't update, even after entering everything manually.",3

So you send out 20 payments and enter them into the app, but according to the app, you haven't spent a dime. Then when the transaction hits your bank, this app is too stupid to merge the two. Great app if you want to have a hundred NSF charges. You're better off having a paper ledger. Consider yourself lucky if this even connects to your online bills. It randomly connects for me then forgets later. Can't connect to Comcast or AT&T. I know those are small unknown companies...",1

Maybe it's just me but I like to keep track of my gas consumption per month, based on how much I drove. I think it'll be nice and handy if I can consolidate them on Mint.",2

140640,"Hi, The reason I am at the app store and writing this review is because I was looking for a different app to switch to. I am totally disappointed at the new update. The update just made an app that is supposed to be used perhaps several times a day, much more cumbersome. The current 4.2 star rating will plummet within days with this update and it will take years to build it back to a 4 star. I am still wondering why wouldn't Mint come up with a paid version without ads?",2

Even though I know what the balance should be, from the banks source data, then I open the app, I see all the transactions but the balance is basically a random number, not what it was, is or should be.

The app offers to add accounts already added but no longer recognized. 3. Splitting a transaction duplicates at least one part in the split and disappears another transaction.

140710,Great tracker,0
140711,She's easy to use. I like it over the other small stupid graphs you get in the other lame apps.,0
140712,Very helpful. Specifically the extra financial news,0
140713,"Works pretty well, and better now than last year. Really all you can ask from an app developer, especially a free app. I pay $50/month for the Trainwreck that is YouTube TV, and apparently, Intuit is getting better developer talent, inexplicably. There are less obtrusive ads on this free app, than the app I pay $50/month for that shows, seemingly, an equal amount of ads as content.",0
140714,The Mint app is efficient and very helpful. I just hope that it doesn't show errors when I try to refresh it. I have to unlink and relink my bank details every single time I want to view my latest transaction. Please fix the error. It does deserve a 5 star.,1
140715,"I have been looking for an app like this for a long time. Mint knocks it out of the park. Link all your accounts together, i.e. bank, insurance, 401k, electric bill, etc. Then establish a budget and this app tracks it all. This is now my favorite app. Hands down.",0
140716,Helps consolidate all my accounts and categorizes my expenses,0
140717,"The app is kind of useless. It's fine for seeing your expenses at a glance, but anything past that and you need to be on a computer. You can't batch change expenses, credit card accounts are constantly unlinking, and pop-ups will suddenly close mid-edit. It makes me resent Mint that I cannot do some of the most basic tasks in the app and must be tied to computer - the whole point of Mint is to make my financial life easier, no?",9
140718,Google knows where I live so why even list it? Anything like this for uk users? Pageonce? Spreadsheet in docs prob!,0
140719,Wonderful App which gives an Accurate information and Update of stock market trading information .,1

140735,And it is free!,0
140736,"Unintuitive, lacks features. Too much space used to push ads. Widgets seem unchanged for a decade; waste screen space. Intuit like 2 🍆 you around. Want to sign in with 2FA? Fine, but don't paste the code or else you get a error code that doesn't tell you what the problem is. Used to email receipt for 2FA? Nope! Not after they get enough personal info and don't disclose the change of behavior. Intuit cares by way of the 🍄 treatment; feed them 💩 and keep them in the 🌑.",7
140737,Its an amazing app. Especially I like the Screener feature.,1
140738,Great! I use it to analyze stocks I'm interested in investing in and it doesn't let you down at all!,0
140739,"I love that I am able to connect to my bank and track my spending.  I am also so thankful to see my bills and have one place to monitor all of my spending. The one BIG drawback I am finding is that some of the things I have a budget created for will not report that that money is actually spent there. I would like to be able to adjust it manually if it doesn't sync with my transactions from my bank account. With this not adjusting, I can't keep an accurate account of my spending. I really love Mint but this is huge and I have been looking into other apps. Please fix💞",8
140740,Its good but sometimes it doesn't update the accounts.,0
140741,I've been using mint for many years now. It is constantly being upgraded. Love the mint stories and net worth features,0

140966,It's useful,0
140967,Always have issues syncing bank info due to the app saying there were always unread messages but read all messages and deleted all read messages via the bank website. I tried for three months but never worked.  Trying out Prism for better results.,0

Capitol one?? schools first credit union?? none of these were able to link accounts just went back to try it again. says best buy wont work citi came thru. schools first did not.,20
140970,Great app to check your portfolio on the go. I wish I could add a stock to one of my lists just by selecting the list I'd like to use. I don't understand why I need to scroll down and select save. Two touches/steps to verify feels unnecessary and inefficient for this,41

140981,"At first, I thought this app was great. Helped me build a budget and keep track of my finances. Unfortunately, it incorrectly categorizes almost everything, to the point that I spent more time correcting the app and renaming my transactions than I did budgeting. It constantly put gas stations under entertainment and even miscategorized a bookstore purchase as a bank fee. Almost everything fell under ""uncategorized,"" which is, of course, useless for budgeting. Also won't let me note that an account closed.",1

140990,Excellent app of its species - just wish the featured news stories and commentators were more focused on international markets and economic events - as the app once was - and not so USA centric - the future is global - and not wholly defined and determined within the US borders...,10
140991,"This is a great budgeting tool for people trying to gain control over their finances. I do wish that some of the features were more like the website. For example I'd like more flexible and powerful search capabilities when viewing my past transactions. I also wish I could add new transaction categories like I can on the website. There are a few services that aren't supported by Mint such as adding your Cash App as an account. Overall, it's still a useful application!",19
140992,Unacceptable service. I had to jump through hoops sending and resending my information to get approved to use and I could have forgiven that BUT now after I have made multiple trades and have money invested on this platform I start getting emails saying my account and money are locked from me until I send a picture of me HOLDING my identification AND a paper with today's date in order to use my account. All this after I have invested is completely unacceptable.,40

No help contact (some of my transactions show up duplicate due to a glitch & there's no way on mobile 2 fix this or 2 ask for help from Mint). The mobile doesnt show the goals you can set on desktop.

141072,"Generally, the app has been good at what it does. It doesn't update accounts as fast as using the actual account's app (BoA app, for example), but I think that's to be expected. What I don't like is that every so often, when I'm doing something else on my phone, the Mint app boots itself up and asks me to login again. When I then login, I find that my preferences have all been reset, and it has to go through the long process of updating everything. It seems to be random, and is very annoying.",0

It's frustrating to lose visibility to the goals I've set for saving and debt repayment on a mobile platform where I could use it most.

141693,I cant even download the application. I was really hoping to try it.,0
141694,"Does most things well, except for investment tracking.",0
141695,"Options screener is awful .. just a few stocks, no ITM for spreads, no volumes .. completely waste of time.",1
141696,"Mint has given increased confidence from having accurate information from all accounts to help stay atop of budgets, savings, and credit scores all in one location. Mint helps my wife and i have informed financial discussions together as a team. thanks.",1
141697,Needs work. Nothing syncs to your accounts. Doesn't have pending or on hold shows up .,0
141698,It works well and rapidly.  What else can I ask for?,1
141699,like it a lot,0
141700,Mint works great no matter where on the scale your financial skills are. It is also a fine teaching experience  allowing a lot of insight into just how your money is spent and giving the user an easy to use  budget tuning took. I am still making small adjustments as life changes over time.,0
141701,"I really enjoy CNBC app. It is the perfect tool to follow through on one's personal finance and the world economical vibes. However, I do not appreciate the fact that my watchlist cannot go over thirty stocks.",0
141702,Icant add my bank accounts or anything.....will thisbe fixed?,0
141703,it's incredibly poorly designed. don't bother,0
141704,"I recommend not installing CNBC app and if you have it installed, uninstall it. There are 14 trackers and 20 permissions, which 3 permissions are extremely worrisome. READ_PHONE_STATE gives permission for the CNBC app to see your number and the number of the person you are talking too, and it pulls your identity along with the person you are talking to. WOW talk about invasion of privacy.",125
141705,"Pretty good, missing some key info like options, key statistics, financials.",0
141706,"I like that it connects to all my financials so seamlessly, but one thing that makes the budgeting portion of the app annoying to use is that you can't edit the category of an expenditure until it's finished pending, and Mint is REALLY bad at guessing which category you want it filed under. This results in having to wait, often, three days after you spend money to correct the transaction in your budget. Would be 5/5 if you could edit the category before it finished pending!",43
141707,Lots of usefull financial info offered,0
141708,Good information on time..,1
141709,I love most of what it has to offer. I do wish however I could get my banking information to update through the app instead of having to log into the website.,0
141710,Great app for financial information. No ads to disturb you here is what I liked most,1
141711,The app is so slow! It takes forever for it to load tickers or even the current activity in the markets. I used to love how fast the app used to be but now it takes 2-4 mins for it to load anything. Its to the point where there isn't even a reason for having it. Let alone trying to use it 🤷‍♂️,1
141712,"Very simple, way to use, and organized way to keep track of all your money and accounts!",1
141713,"Drained my battery life like crazy the last two days. I'm done with this 
app for awhile. Maybe I'll see what it's like in a few months.",0
141714,Increasingly less useful. Lack of customization of your accounts is also weird. As an example sets my Line of Credit as a credit card instead of a loan (can't manually change for some reason) and then doesn't let me set the actual interest rate on the account because it's lower than what it's expecting for a credit card.  The UI is growing more and more out of fashion and it wasn't stellar to begin with.,0
141715,"Been using for years. Makes it easy to track investments, bills and find purchase info for warranty issues quickly. Anything that simplifies life, yay!",0
141716,This a really good app but last week onwards it won't show real time update of market. Even though market trading already started it has around 40 minutes delay.this issue only with srilanka share market update. please solve this issue it will be really helpful for us.,6
141717,Great app Ez to use,0
141718,"Only complaint is that it lags behind a bit,  when when you refresh.",0
141719,I'm unable to load any transactions on my linked accounts. This issue is directly related to updating to the most recent version of the app. Please fix.,1
141720,Requires your phone number and that you link bank accounts. No thanks,1
141721,I love the clarity and simplicity of this app. It is my absolute go to app for quote and news look ups.,0
141722,Great app.....I like it..,0
141723,"All my accounts in one place to track expenses with no manual input on my part. Awesome! Tweaked a few things  on the full website, but this is awesome!",0
141724,Much more flexible than other budget apps I tried.,0
141725,As a beginner i find it quite useful and simple to understand,0
141726,Awesome for new traders...easy to analysis the coins & forex....also commodities I love it...,7
141727,"Latest update, getting ""unexpected error please try again"" for notification in Android. Not showing notifications in notification drawer anymore",0
141728,Total pain to get setup. constantly having to verify accounts that have already been verified. I just want a better way of tracking/ remembering to pay bills,0
141729,"App features are minimal compared to web based platform. Web based platform is relatively easy to use, though can be confusing to learn at first. Lots of useful features and recommend everyone to use it.",4
141730,I already PAID to remove ads but why still showing ads??? Even when trying to re-purchase again and says I already purchased. Use at your own RISK,0
141731,Expecting Indian version soon,0
141732,"Great app to keep track of your budget and upcoming bills. It definitely helps when you're in a hole like me, and want to be able to budget out to improve your debt/credit score. A few of my bills are with companies that the app doesn't support, that's why I give it 4 out of 5.",1
141733,Not as good since Intuit bought it. Not as user-friendly and difficult to sign in. Stopped using for several years.,1
141734,Overall a good app which allows tracking of stocks and Crypto simultaneously. Cannot figure out why the widget does not work though. Everytime I add the widget - it says no portfolio found. Please help,40
141735,"The app version is way better than the desktop one. I dont know why yahoo messed up its desktop version, which was and probably still is the most popular finance stock info site",0
141736,The only thing that irritates me is not being able add accounts without having an online profile with them. I have a small bank which doesn't have those capabilities.,0
141737,good for check fx futures etc.,0
141738,"It's a great app. However, i am unable to add or remove stocks from the watchlist. Shows an error when I try to perform this. Please fix the error or let me know how to get this fixed.",1
141739,I love the app wish I could get stock news by clicking the stock on the watcher section like jstock.,5
141740,Last update completely screwed up viewing my portfolio. all I can see is the symbol and price!!!,0
141741,Nearly perfect app. Couple of improvements needed but nearly there.,2
141742,Love this thing,0
141743,"Disgusting despicable move. EDIT, not editing. I'm aware you're not a broker but your app was buggy as hell at a pivotal time which is why I left my review.",13
141744,"The app rarely works since the update.  If i'm lucky, I can update my info 2x a day, but on a normal day, it won't update at all.  Constantly ""unable to connect,"" yet a manual connect will work fine.  What happened?",0
141745,"By far one of the best apps in terms of money aggregation, budgeting & expense tracking. One issue I see the duplication of data in cash & investments such as IRA account etc. Would be great if that can be fixed",0
141746,"It's good for organizational purposes, but the refresh to make accounts current is horrible!  Especially over the weekend.  It's Monday morning and I have refreshed the app about 10 times and the last transaction shown is from Friday,  but I've been using my card all weekend.  I like to keep a very close watch on my money and this app is proving to be very inefficient for that task.   If not addressed soon, I will definitely be looking for a better app.",0
141747,Doesn't work on razr,1
141748,Works for me!,0
141749,not realtime update sometimes..,0
141750,Title says it all.,0
141751,Great for tracking stocks and getting market news.,4
141752,News section need improvement.,0
141753,Once the app gets a little more versitile it will be perfect.,0
141754,if you're the one don't trust in old station sorry but its the best future,0
141755,"I love the app so far, but I wish there were a way to get current account totals as a persistent notification rather than a widget",1
141756,"I use the app several times a day for a quick check on the major averages and on my own largest holdings. The only issue is the graphing often stops after the first couple hours. A second graph that is provided does usually work. All in all, a good app.",9
141757,Easy to use for tracking investments,1
141758,The app will not open,0
141759,"Do you want your finance app to 1) keep reminding you to move your Google portfolio here even if you never had one 2) randomly switch the order of your stocks, and the currency in which everything is denominated 3) send you notifications about every event in every stock that was in your portfolio 5 years ago for a month? Then definitely get yahoo finance, it was custom made for you!",9
141760,Nice design and smooth intertace and navigation.,0
141761,I'm using a Samsung Galaxy s6 on Android 6 and it keeps on crashing when I try to open the app. Hopefully they can fix/update it quickly.,0
141762,"After the update this app has become very slow and buggy. Simple tasks like editing lists, searching and adding new stocks in the list takes ages or doesn't happen at all with the screen blanking out or not loading properly. Plz fix it asap.",19

141766,Very important apps,0

141770,Very nice presenting of stats,0

141776,"Gathers all your c.cards debt cards, checks used and shows u ur expenses for tje month. Would like the  options to see previos months, maybe u can and I just havent figured it out yet? Otherwise flawless",0
141777,"Like a doting mom, Mint tracks your financial history and helps create a budget you can actually stick to. Alerts notify you of anything and everything going on with your cash, and the charts and graphs make it easy to visualize where your money is going. It's a fiscal bird's-eye view, allowing you to oversee everything and swoop in when anything seems a little off-kilter.",0

142180,"Have used Mint for years, love how it integrates all my accounts so I can have a complete picture of my finances. Sometimes some accounts will have trouble linking, but these are almost always due to the bank, not Mint, and Mint customer service has been very helpful with these issues.",0

142195,"This app is crucial for me to stay in top of school loans, spending, and savings. It has all my accounts in one location so that I don't have to login to 5 of them separately. I love the budget feature, I used to track this on a spreadsheet but that was cumbersome and easy for me to not record an expense if I knew I was going to go over budget. This keeps me in check and I love it. I wish the app had more features like the browser version does, which is why I didn't give 5 stars.",1

Keep it up Yahoo 👍🏽 -EDIT- @Yahoo, there are major shortcomings though; price alert push notifications never worked, and as of the latest update, you've taken away the ability to shear Yahoo!

143020,I use this app regularly to track my spending on my credit card and my savings.

143070,Excellent !!!!!!!,0
143071,I wish some more things that can be edited on the website could be edited in the app because the website isn't good at all for use on a tablet or smartphone. I can't mark duplicate transactions in the app. I can't edit categories. I think there are a couple more things I can't think of but this is a real problem for me.

I cannot connect to all of my accounts due to security features so I cannot get a full view of my finances. 2. I love the blogs they highlight, but I can never find it after I accidentally click out or something. 3. When I try to search through the categories for the blog, it cuts off after the ""family"" and ""how to"" categories, so I can't search for the categories below those options as I cannot even see what they are. Aside from these issues, it's a great app.",1

143219,Love it. Very easy to manage and review finances and transactions.,0
143220,"This is the family go-to app for accurate, timely, intra-day price data. We believe enhancements would improve the app. Examples: 1) Add daily & yearly high & low prices to trade display screen. 2) Add PEG to statistics. Actually, create a clone of Yahoo's statistics display. 3) Significantly improve up-to-date corporate news. At present, we're hard-pressed to determine reasons for current price action. Thanks for what you have; we'll hope to see the some enhancements.",61
143221,"No tiene herramientas. Ni siquiera se puede trazar una linea de tendencia. TradingView lo hace muy bien, por ejemplo.",0
143222,Excellent App.... Trustworthy.,0
143223,"I had Mint Bills before they discontinued it for this terrible app. My 
accounts/bills are never updated accurately and I'm always having to sync 
them again. It shows the balances instead of bill amounts, so it shows that 
my bills come to $25k+ every month which throws off my budget numbers. 
Bring the old app back or simplify the app to include it.",4

143225,Very helpful and informative.,0
143226,I would say it is one the best application for tracking share prices in global market.,1
143227,"I wish 'Spending by Category' still worked, meaning it no longer lists and is just a picture (I reported it but nothing happened). Listing 'Spending by Category' was the best budgeting tool of this App, the app still is great how it pulls all accounts together.",0

143235,"Chart colour selection not work properly & Add supertrande , Pivot indicator",0
143236,"This is such an essential app! It's like having your own, personal financial advisor that is available 24/7. My favorite feature has to be the Advice section, hands down! This app tailors financial advice specifically from analyzing and comparing your financial account activity...it gives tips I would likely have NEVER recognized had it not been presented to me. And that's just one feature. It's extremely rare for me to write reviews... but I was compelled to write this one. Must have app. Period.",4
143237,I like that you can check your portfolio performance for the day but I really wish that you can check your overall portfolio worth like you can do on the pc,0
143238,I just got this app and most things seem to work well. I really enjoy having all my expenses in one place. For the life of me I cannot get my vystar account to connect. It always fails to send me a security code. I use vystar as my main bank so it all falls apart without it. If I could get that to work it would be perfect.,1
143239,Was fine before. New version sucks. Can't even enlarge the text.,1

What a shame to ruin such a great app.👎👎",3

143268,"I lost all I had😭😭am zero guys....I invested heavilly,I went on a consistend loss,its a scam platform...",0
143269,edit-5/16 beyond frustrated with the new app. I have had enough. I will be deleting the app ams will start using the Dave Ramsey Every Dollar app. Yes some of the features require a subscription but I trust DR and it confirms the old saying... you get what you pay for. So long and good luck to those who choose to stay. original message - hate the newest update. I get the app is free but that doesn't mean you ruin something that was working perfectly fine. I'm so frustrated,8
143270,"A comprehensive, easy to comprehend clearinghouse for news and information about what is going on in the world of money. Always helpful and often entertaining, I read the articles and analysis for information as well as entertainment. I would encourage everyone to download the app and use it daily, whether you target your investments, work through a broker, pay into your 401k and forget it, or just give a damn about what's going on in the world. This is a one stop shop and it can't be beat!",29

143272,Good application,0
143273,This app is for tracking stocks and investments,0
143274,No longer runs after latest android update to lollipop.  Need to find a new stocks app now.,1
143275,"Doesn't update account balances accurately, and ""current"" balances are days old. If I went by this, my accounts would be overdrawn by hundreds of $'s",0
143276,this new update is not working well. the prices aren't updating with a swipe. you have to back out of it then go back in to refresh. pretty frustrating. also the spacing is too much. makes the view not af compact as before. I'm on android Samsung s9.,0
143277,Strongly recommend this App to anyone who desires to stay properly informed on the financial markets.,0

143291,excellent tool,0
143292,Nags you for a rating,0
143293,Like ..it much...,0
143294,Searching in transactions is annoying because you have to search on a particular vendor. A generic search across all fields/tags would be nice.,0
143295,Great app. For anyone. Truly an unbiased news source for all current events!,0
143296,The tool doesn't calculate a consistent net worth between screens. Support said that due to legacy and technical reasons this was expected. Math is apparently hard for this product dev team.,0
143297,Could be better if layouts can be set as defauts.,0
143298,But it's ok for fast quotes...,0
143299,Exceptional... if you're serious about tracking your spending. Sometimes the app miscodes what your spending and where. IE alcohol when I pulled from an atm that was attached to a bank near it. If you sync your accounts and look at them and keep it organized you will be better at tracking (increase awareness) of⅕ your spending overall.,2
143300,Just what I needed,0
143301,"Good for keeping track of all your credit cards, loans, income, spending, and investments . Overall above accurate snap shot of your personal finances on this secure app with little to no advertising other than the credit cards they 'recommend' for you .",0

143308,"Very good app. Mint has improved a lot over the years. I remember years ago, it couldn't keep up with all my accounts so I switched to Bill Guard but then the app was deactivated so I decided to give Mint another try. The one improvement I would suggest would be to group all accounts by institution. I have many savings/checking accounts with multiple banks but for some reason Mint mixes them all in a random order which makes it hard to find what I'm looking for.",2
143309,Is fast and I know  instantly where I am standing with my investments.,0
143310,"Used to love this app.  With the new update,  it now no longer shows me any transactions under any accounts.  Makes it almost useless.",0
143311,Liked it but I have to re sync my accounts every couple of days because they won't update. Please fix,0
143312,Very good app,0
143313,For intraday trading on future. I need 3 min chart. Since its gann no. Also it works good for price action trades. But here minimum is 1 min and then direct 5 min. If 3 min comes means I would rate it as more then 5 star.,2

143325,Great stock watching app!,0
143326,"Got my account to work but this is still a stupid app. You can't tell it to define future transactions as being in a specific category. The widget has no options for which balance to show. Can't see historical content in the same way as current information. Not a fan. Worse than not a fan now, the level of complexity to delete your account so mint no longer has access to your data is disgusting. The official mint website literally provides wrong information then the intuit one gives an error 404",4
143327,Helps me see where my money goes and helps make financial goals,0
143328,"I really like this app and would give it 4 or 5 stars before, but the latest update screwed up the widget.  It used to be very useful but now is not at all.

143519,"Great app, but I wish it had a way to automatically track reinvestment of dividends.",2
143520,Love that it keeps track of your spending once it learns your routine expenses.,0

143561,Thank to this app,0
143562,This app is wonderful when it works. It has comprehensive functionality to help with managing investments. However it crashes at launch more often than not and is unusable for me on most days. I can't quite remember exactly when this started - it never used to be like this but it's been happening for a long long while now.,1071
143563,I'm having to switch to another app due to the latest updates. Too much hassle just to see the current prices for my portfolio of stocks.,0

143570,"A good companion to the web site.  Refresh rate for some banks is rather slow,  but I believe that is on the bank side.",0
143571,"It is okay, but I wish they would account for my subscriptions and bills. My electric and heating is with one provider, but the bills are separate and Mint cannot pick up on that, so it only selects one... I would like them to also be more open to crypto(Webull crypto and others), as that is a great deal of my investments and they don't carry it or transfer it over.",2
143572,"I really like mint although the fact that I can't track cash makes things very difficult. There is a work around although its not good. Until cash no longer exists, please natively put in a way to track cash. I'll have to uninstall until then.",2

143605,Good up to the minute financial news. Ability to track specific stock performance.,0
143606,Mint no longer updates my banking account transactions and no longer connects to my credit card accounts. Uninstalling this and using a competitors product that works just fine. Mint needs to spend more time QA'ing and fully testing a product before they release it.,0
143607,Never disappointed. Great tips and info And always gives you updates every week,0

143626,For the last three days I couldn't open it. The app keep loading and asking for connection. Tried to reinstall with the same result....,5
143627,This app does what it say on the tin. Great for live share prices and personalised portfolio with major markets but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who's a real investor (investing his own earned money).The constant access to this app would make you do trades that wouldn't otherwise do. I uninstalled it after less than a week of use. I don't need the extra stress.,0
143628,Can't arrange order of the stocks as i need. Get useless push notifications.,18

143639,Issue has not been fixed as developer stated. Can not search for all US equity symbols. Example CRNC and UPST. These both trade NASDAQ and do not come up in search along with many others.,5
143640,"App is Good but I'm having problems with my notifications,that's all",0
143641,I like the functionality bit the new UI is godawful,5
143642,App is unusable with full screen popup ads without close buttons,0

143654,"I downloaded this app thinking it would be helpful....had it for 10 mins and now I'm gonna uninstall. It is not at all easy to use. I can't find my banks or make it work with the app. I dont even write reviews, but I will for this because it's one of the least helpful apps I have tried.",0
143655,Quite helpful app. Allows me to follow the markets real time and set up a portfolio for particular stocks with details.,0
143656,"App seems very useful to search according to criteria you set. Too bad the incredibly intrusive ads aren't there to sell as much as to force you to get the expensive premium service. Sure it's worth paying for but the amount they're charging is in range of Zack's or Motley Fool.. which give actual advice. WARNING: if you try to sign up with Google or with Email, don't be surprised to get caught in an endless waiting loop that never completes.. tried on 2 separate devices, same result.",92
143657,Bad app too buggy and old. Also their content is definitely edited to control narrative however they see fit. They post false narratives and almost never post truthful articles/news stories.,16
143658,"This app is so freaking amazing. You just have to download it yourself. When I saw the advice and alerts, I was in love. Absolutely awesome.",0

143660,"Hated the forced switch from mint bills.  I loved the former because that's exactly what it was,  just a nice simple app that let me view and keep track of my bills, balances, and due dates.  I'm not interested in any of this other junk mint shoves in my face.  I don't want the dashboard, the trends,  the advice, the blogs, blah blah blah.  Mint is buggy, does not sync effectively,  and does not give me what I'm looking for.  Simply want it to look and function like mint bills.  I will be uninstalling and finding a new bill app.",2
143661,Good Apps when you are on move,0
143662,The update really killed this app... Took it from 5 to really less than 1...can I give it a zero...rarely updates anymore...pathetic,1

143665,I seem to be having the same problem as a lot of others... My bank has security questions and I can't get past the add bank portion... I was really looking forward to using this app too...,0

143668,It needs to load faster.,0
143669,Great for keeping me informed,0
143670,"Great app for US insight. Good headlines, and content when needed!",0
143671,"The customer support is mediocre at best. I was having issues adding my bank account to keep track of my transactions. I contacted them both through email and chat. Both people I informed that for personal reasons, I had my bank account removed from my wife's mint account. Then I tried to add it on my mint account. I was having issues saying on my phone ""the account already exists in their system"" so I contacted them, they had me check on The banks site (which it worked fine). The person on chat had me try on the computer and I was getting ""incorrect login credentials"" as an error and they had me do the same thing (guess what, logged into The bank's site just fine). I had contacted them four times, and got nothing solved. The person on chat said the would escalate it and the new person told me my login credentials was incorrect. How many times does a person need to tell a person that my login credentials are correct before they decide maybe mint is having an issue. I told them even that my bank usually has me do a second verification other than just simply logging in, and suggested that might be the issue, or it could be because my bank account was attached to my wife's mint account originally. I ill advise this app because of the issues I experienced with both the app and mint's customer support. They are highly incompetent and do not listen.",0
143672,"Fine for real time quotes and market news, but needs to separate out the ""professional"" analysts opinion articles disguised as news. ALSO the Conversations boards are frequently full of spam posts and highly toxic. Very difficult to find stimulating discussion in the boards. Recommend Stocktwits ap and Investopedia if you are looking for public discussion forums.",4
143673,It looks like something i can allaborate too.,2
143674,Great app. My bank stopped working 7-8 months ago. It shouldn't take this long to fix. Goodbye mint.,0

143677,"So dam slow now, what happened to a good app?",0
143678,I'm considering changing my rating overall for Mint to 1 Star. For the past couple of lonths I have been trying to find out why I am unable to access my account. I have sent emails and chatted with multiple people with Mint Customer Support and Intuit QuickBooks and have been given the run around.,0
143679,The best info round the clock. Very useful,0
143680,Like to see divided,0
143681,It seems pretty complete for basic stuffs. I recommend it for sure,0
143682,Helps me keep track where my money goes each month. Reminds me when bills are due. Even keep track of my credit score;) Shows me where I should make some adjustments with spending too. Great app!,0
143683,use the gadget on my homepage daily. works well,1
143684,Awesome app,0
143685,Handy if you already have portfolio(s) in Yahoo finance. Make changes in only one place.,0
143686,Been using this app for some time now and its absolutely fantastic. Quick easy and simple,0
143687,For a quick check of the Indexes and stocks that I'm following this is a great tool.,3
143688,Worked great til about 3 month's ago then insisted I re-enter login details every time I viewed my watchlist... Now it just refuses to log in at all. Isn't there any testing done before rolling out updates? :(,2
143689,I like the app and would welcome the ability to enter the quantity and price I bought my shares at. It would then be good to show the percentage increase or decrease since purchase as well as the change in price per day.,0
143690,East to navigate app. Able to follow my investments. Fast updates. Multiple accounts.,0
143691,Easy to use,0

143709,Awesome app,0
143710,"This is great app but slower when compared to the old one and when we can see chart it is not updated properly in the first look , I need to rotate and see the chart coming in to show latest price",0
143711,like the new look much better. faster too.,0
143712,Powerful app and financial tool. I have used for many years and it only gets better! Thank you Mint!,0
143713,Requires a password so complex you can't remember it. Then doesn't allow automatic login.,1
143714,The layout is clear and easy to read.,0
143715,Excellent app. Was waiting for such a service. Highly recommended for trader's and investors. Need to add share option for News.,1

143720,Give me back my old widget!,1
143721,Best provided free future's that's a good,0
143722,Easy to use. My only use of this app is in watching markets and getting a big picture. Charts are too simple to be of any use. Overall ... it does what I expect from a free app.,4
143723,"The app is good overall.  However, it f4eezes up when you try to get a stock quote or an after hours quote.",0
143724,Very good and always up to the minute,0
143725,This app is gay but ok,0
143726,Great way to see your financial picture.,0
143727,"Well organized, good app",0
143728,love that for us,0
143729,Would be much better if search capability was improved to be at least as good as the web site. Specifically would like to be able to do searches like '-tag:reconciled' to see all transactions that I have yet to tag 'reconciled'.,0
143730,I love this app.,0
143731,Looks good and provides key business news updates,0
143732,Nice layout! Great app!,0
143733,"I use it to keep track of my expenses, now I know where my money goes",0
143734,Timely and relevant.,0
143735,Love this app for budgeting and reviewing transactions in one place. Only complaint is that there are very few new features being added. There is a lot of untapped potential here...,5
143736,Good I hope this app is real,0
143737,"This app used to work. In the past few months, it stopped working completely. Nothing updates. I don't understand why they changed anything. Yahoo always was a favorite of mine and now it's worthless for quotes.",0
143738,My connection problems have been solved-- for the moment.  This is a great service (including this app and the web app) WHEN IT IS WORKING.  There are recurring problems with account updating.  If I can go 30 days without dropping a connection to one of my accounts I will give this app 5 stars.    UPDATE:  Mint has been disconnected from my bank for two weeks with no follow up from support.  Connection to PayPal is 50% of the time at best.  I am done.  Deleted all accounts and closed the mint account.  Feel like I wasted a whole lot of time and energy the past few months.  Perhaps they should have let consumers know that the product was a not-ready-for-prime-time Alpha version.,3
143739,"It's a great idea, but I'm going to be extremely hesitant to allow a third party app to have complete access to my bank and credit card accounts and passwords.",0
143740,"Excellent, really helped me get a lot more profit with every investment",3
143741,Really like the overview of portfolios.,1
143742,Are all quotes live and real time no delays on the paid version?,0
143743,For a finance/stocks & shares app to say that I am 6 figures in the red when all the other portfolios I use say that I'm in profit obviously means that this app cannot add up or calculate correctly. Not a good example for a supposedly high quality app. Also it only allows you to enter share prices in £/p for UK not simply Pence which is the actual trading currency therefore as it rounds to 2 decimal places it must be inaccurate in the share prices eg a share that costs 109p would appear as £0.11p. Overall a completely inaccurate presentation tool which to me is a waste of time.,22
143744,Was very useful until started  reporting incorrect balance all the time for my checking...,1
143745,You have to re-enter your portfolio that you have on the website....totally useless.!,0
143746,I use the watchlist & enjoy getting the breaking financial news. I wish you would just stream the channel all the time even if I'm not affiliated with a cable TV provider. This would seriously improve your viewership.,4
143747,I'm deleting this app because of the Liberal politics it mixes into financial news,0
143748,app has problem viewing chart in landscape or full view,1
143749,Showing no connection....froze...many times....will not load....still not loading....I have a $200 modem...everything else is working except this app,5
143750,Too small. Inadequate representation of the PC version,0
143751,This app has so much adds its impossible to trade this really bad,0
143752,Very helpful app to keep track of alllll your different finances.,0
143753,"This app is phenomenal! So easy to analyze what you've been spending and what your trends are. It's exactly what I need to manage my expenses as well as manage my assets! Keep up the great work. If a separation can be added, like having 2 profiles in 1 that would be great",0
143754,"A perfect application to understand my money flow. Ready to pay for this app, great UI and has good charts. Easy to use.",1

143774,Easy to use,0
143775,great work designers and developers.,0
143776,Too many ads,0
143777,Great investment app,0
143778,Now ads which suck but it should also auto alphabetize the stocks.,0
143779,Very intuitive and fluid.,0
143780,"I wish it has more various features but it's still pretty good as it is now. I wish there is a feature where you can set up some budgets in a bigger categories. For example, my budget of groceries and shopping will be $X kind of thing.",0
143781,Love it. Will definitely use it.,0
143782,Continues to be slow and prices are not accurate. Needs much improvement,1
143783,Use it every day to keep up to date,3
143784,"Top many articles and teasers that cannot be read, whether: 1) ridiculously long article for ad revenue or 2) need to subscribe to some site to get the article. Is this a news source? NO. It's a revenue source ONLY for Yahoo.",2
143785,"App has not updated since 12/21/20, awaiting new updated app, per website it should of updated on 1/6/21.....",0
143786,It's keep me going,0
143787,Great app regularly updated,0
143788,iPod touches used to have a default stock app made by Yahoo that had one feature I love and can't find anywhere else. Yahoo's current app doesn't have it. I could touch any two points on a stocks timeline and see the difference in price. This helped in stimulating what it would have been like to buy and sell at many different points quickly. Also it would be helpful to be able to lay several stock histories together. Like transparent images and be able to stretch-squeeze x and y and slide each history up down left right to align patterns for analysis,1
143789,Restrictive and limited. Sh!thouse,0
143790,Really THIS APP VERY USEFUL FOR TRADING AND ANALYSIS,0
143791,Very easy to navigate and allows you to see all your finances under one umbrella.,0
143792,Decent content but much too slow.,2
143793,"A very simple application to use, yet a very useful and powerful app. It gives a comprehensive dashboard of all the budget, expenses, drill downs, goals etc. Relieves me of the complex effort of tracking expenses across different cards and banks. lets me manage it all from one place.",1
143794,I love having the info in one place. The visualizations (especially for investments and stocks) could be better. But solid app overall. I've heard Personal Capital has better visualizations. I also wish the goals were easier to manage and set up.,0
143795,Nice stock market app.. easy to use and keep track,0
143796,I love how easy it is to check my budget! Thanks!,0
143797,"Cant do withoit it. this app is my single view of my finances. it provides me a great perspective and a view into my expenses. of course it would be awesome to have forecaating, but even a simple rearview is great.",0
143798,Good for beginners too,0
143799,App has been very slow and buggy lately not to mention I can't update my Fidelity linked account stock info. It was working all right until you guys broke it.,0
143800,"I've provided screen shots, I've spoken to support several times, it's still not resolved and I'm still getting ads. Likely because my subscription renewed just prior to the price hike and it's easier for investing to have me cancel my subscription rather than honor the agreed upon price of my original subscription of 19.99 for one year.",168
143801,"good, useful, fairly easy to use",0
143802,Great app to check market news and prices,0

143816,"I've used mint for over 5 years, and the improvements they've made to make it more user friendly and dynamic are awesome.

143858,Good apparently,0
143859,I've been using this app for about 8 years. Some of the changes have been great. Some of them have made the app clunky and unfriendly. This newest update is making me question why I use this. To have the advertisements be the first thing you see each time you refresh the page (and take up the whole page) makes it feel like you french fry'd when you should've pizza'd. Update: I reverted to version 6.21 and disabled auto updates. Very happy again. Thanks for your response.,3
143860,I can't download this app. I keep pressing download and it does absolutely nothing. I know the problem is not my phone cause I can download any other app. Any suggestions on what I could to fix this?,0

143870,Helps me keep track of my money. Crashes every time I want to look at my credit score details please fix thank you,0
143871,Seems like a flaw when an app designed to sync with your bank account information fails to sync. I want to love and use this app but i can't because it doesn't do what it's suppose to. I guess I'm onto another app. Get it together! Don't make available until you've worked out the kinks!,3

143877,Would be great if stocks prices showed the next decimal place rather than rounding,0
143878,Constantly crashes,0
143879,"Chart is good as I can add indicators and save as template. However there is no option to change STOCK CODE while on full chart mode. Only work around is go back to portrait view, change stock code, go to full chart mode and add indicators. Quite tedious and time consuming.",23

The only way for me to regain my privacy was you delete all of my messages so that nobody has a link of me to click on.

144045,Its great that it creates a budget and gives you alerts. Yay can add all your accounts and see them in one place but it doesn't update the balance if my bank accounts accurately so it seems like I have no money.

I would like that if you have a repeated transaction that you categorize under a specific title that it would recognize it and change it from there on out,1

It makes it impossible to track stocks in real time and have to use my brokers level 2 for actual prices. 1/5 till they fix this.",28

The only minor improvement with a significant impact would be to allow users to choose colors for each of the lines in the comparison mode.

I've now contacted Google regarding a refund on my subscription to Yahoo Finance Premium in the amount of $378.86 which was charged to my credit card on 2.6.20 I originally canceled my Yahoo Finance Premium subscription on 2.2.20 which was 2 days before the trial period ended on 2.4.20. I've contacted Mitchell at about a refund and Mitchell said it wasn't possible to refund the charge. Please assist me in resolving this issue. Update 2.12.20: The irony here is that Yahoo is telling me to contact Google and Google is telling me to contact Yahoo. The payment was charged to my credit card so Yahoo and/or Google have processed the payment.

144270,It was a great app but this up date took something very fast and simple and added needless steps.,0
144271,Works every time. Constantly changing disclaimer. Don't have time to read it over and over. Playing video ads on mobile to darn expensive. Not worth what you have done to it over the last year. Was the favorite app. Others apps almost the same without all the overhead... See ya...,3
144272,Very easy to use and track stocks. Could be more up to dates on the news about articles that come out about stocks. Sometimes I switch over to Google finance and find articles about stocks that I am tracking that yahoo finance didn't have.,1

144282,Only complaints are not all accounts can be added manually. Other then that awesome!!,0
144283,How come iOS is given priority? One example is that iPhone is on version 7.3.0 whereas android is on 6.22.0.63. I just noticed on today's iPhone update my friend is able to set goals why does android not get the update? I love the app still but this game of favourites has to stop 🚫,2

144309,"I'm coming from Mint Bills since that app was going to be discontinued. That app is SO much better at seeing all of your accounts. Everything was broken down in a much simpler and cleaner way.   Ex: I paid a bill off on Friday (from my bank account, not using this app) and got a confirmation this morning it was a received. I refreshed the account on Mint Bills, it was instantly updated. I refreshed the account on Mint, it didn't update at all. It still says I owe the the bill.  I've been using Mint Bills since it was called Pageonce, exclusively on iOS devices. Almost 8 years I've been using it. I saw it go from Pageonce to Check to Mint Bills. To see it go like this, especially after being replaced by this subpar app, it sucks.",15
144310,very easy to see all of your finances all together,0

144312,Having visual representations of where my money is going has changed my whole money budgeting system.,0

144318,"Great app! Deserve 100 stars, but there are only 5 available 🙂",5
144319,Some days it asks for a private security question to be answered but won't accept the right answer.  Then other days it doesn't need need to answer the question and it will work. Very inconsistent or a glitch in the system.,2

144321,"I would give this a 5-star rating for the app but, scrolling when it comes

144352,I like to be able to see my stocks without linking to my personal accounts!,0
144353,The older version was so much better.  On the old app I would be notified of all my upcoming bills. This newer version can't seem to stay logged into my accounts long enough to keep me current.  I had to go back to my old calandar way of keeping my bills up to date.,4
144354,Very beneficial,0
144355,"Since the last update, maybe at the end of 2014 or beginning of 2015, the market indices and quotes have been very close to real time.  I am very happy with it.   There were a few times that it used the day before info.  Hoping Yahoo will fix it at some point",0

144361,Great App. Needs to be able to cache some content offline for reading later. Needs to be able to bookmark content.,0
144362,One of the easiest apps for tracking stocks and business news. Great work Yahoo!,0
144363,"This app has always struggled to figure out investments, but now it seems unable to find my investment accounts altogether. An app that only shows me 1/2 of my financial picture isn't very useful. Edit: In response to the response, no, they were there previously and then disappeared. At last check, they are back, but some are included twice, showing I have significantly more funds than I actually do. I have not made any changes in this time. The issue of not finding smaller institutions is a separate one, but less of an issue for me.",1

144680,Love the potential of this app... some reason setting up accounts is a bit challenging as it is showing double of my auto insurance but not showing my personal property insurance...the desktop and mobile versions arent 100% in sync.,0
144681,Brilliant app where as I am a trader I get up to date info on the markets.,0
144682,constantly glitching. my accounts never show up correctly.,0
144683,Fastest way to see my top stock quotes I am tracking.,0
144684,Sometimes it takes hours and even days to update.,0
144685,"Would be a great app. Could see the potential to help me get on top of my spending habits. I loved the fact that it would sync to my bank account so I didn't have to add every transaction. However, I've had the app for a week now and it won't update my CIBC accounts. The layout is a little confusing at first, but when you figure it all out it all makes sense. Just wish it would sync.",1

144695,"I miss the check.me app that mint took over and shutdown. The interface was so much better and better yet it stayed connected to my credit union.

144706,"This is an excellent app, but I do not like the new font showing the numbers/values of the indexes (DOW, etc) in outline font, they are difficult to read. The prior solid font was far superior for reading the numbers/values. My android tablet updated to Pie today. I wonder if that changed how numbers are displayed in your app.",19
144707,"I like that Mint shows me the most up-to-date account funds. Tracking funds is pretty much what I only use it for. Also, this would have been 5 stars, but some account info are incorrect which is a little bit annoying.",1

144713,"I used to love this app. Ever since the update my accounts won't update. I can't even add my credit card anymore (it says I have the wrong login information, which I dont).   Edit: it's been months since mint started having issues, and they still haven't been resolved. I've contacted customer support and they just tell me that their engineering department is on it.

awesome",1
144729,"I've been a long time user of Mint (5+ years) and it was a very useful tool for a long time. Sadly, in the past year it's gone downhill quickly. Accounts are broken, don't update, and appeals to Mint support take months to resolve, if they are resolved at all. I'm leaving Mint today for a better competing product, the latest series of issues with my Morgan Stanley accounts, which have been seriously broken for 6+ months, make impossible for me to understand my financial position using Mint.",38

144759,"What is new in version 11.5.1 : keep crashing, if not take eternal to load the portfolio until you are totally frustrated to look for another replacement app. Yahoo hasn't come up with a good software for decade.

144771,"Useful, when it worked. I used it for a long time and appreciated the bill tracking, credit score, and how many different categories there are for transactions. After they rolled back the terrible new design to the old UI, it doesn't update accounts anymore, just gets stuck saying it's downloading the information. One of my bills disappeared from my upcoming bills list. I've uninstalled.",0

144778,Excellent but little bit slow in mobile,3
144779,It's frustrating to click on an article only to find I can't read it without subscribing to various publications. If I paid for the WSJ I wouldn't be looking for articles here.

144817,"Update: still a great and secure app. This budget/finance app is just very well put together and isn't too terribly heavy on the adds or promotions. It does a good job of letting you see all your accounts and spending at one place, and then also setting w budget and helping you see where you stand for that month at any time during the month (whether you're meeting your budget or not). No security leaks or problems ever, yet, so your accounts are safe (as long as you're safe on the internet).",43

I consider 3-4 stars average, or pretty much what you'd expect from an app. I rate this app 2 stars b/c even though it performs for the most part, frequently I'll have to re-submit external account info to sync an external account. Also, periodically I change my PW's. My recent PW change resulted in the app being completely cleared of my entire info when I logged in..budgets too. Talk about headache.",14

144838,the push notifications hardly ever open,1

ZERO information is given about them and you cannot interact with or edit anything it puts in the subscription list. You're about better off with an excel spreadsheet.",3

144881,Worked great until it updated. Now it won't work unless I turn off ad blockers. Seems they're trying to lose me as a user.,1
144882,Waaaay better than I thought. I'd read a review on budgeting apps and this one sounded like a great one to try simply because I don't have to write my expenses and purchases down manually (like my mom used to do). It showed me exactly where my money has been going and really shed a light on how serious I need to take my finances. I even told my boyfriend about how much money I was blowing on just food - revealed to me by Mint - and he downloaded the app during our conversation. He was spending what I make in just a week over the course of a few days! I can honestly say that I will never NOT budget again and I now I have a financial plan. Better app than I thought.,8
144883,"Please consider the following improvements 1. Don't make me go to settings to sign out 2. Provide a scrolling feature to see details for monthly spending and income 3.

144894,This app is garbage....waste of time force closes immediately on open because of stupid scottrade banner ad. Fix this yahoo.,1

145027,It's a fine app. But it is very frustrating when you are trying to add a new account that they do not currently support.  So if you use Robinhood or stash be prepared to have to still go to those apps to get any updated info since mint will not show it.,4
145028,"This app is nicely streamlined showing you what your spending, where your spending it and what you earned vs spent each month which is the best feture.

I didn't touch anything I just scrolled down and that ad always keeps poping up for a quick half second and my whole article scrolls up again!

A lot of these finance apps require you to do it manually but Mint is doing it right. They even let you link your bitcoin/crypto wallet accounts.

145071,Good app to monitor your stocks,0
145072,Only thing I'd really like to see is an option to reorder the sections. I like my budget page being at the top,1
145073,Much better now that the format is horizontal! I'd like to see the total of all stocks on that page as well and be able to reorder the columns. Price should be right next to the stock or fund name. It should show the price for the previous day then the current price. 7/16/2022. Still helpful. I hope this new update doesn't screw it up.

145084,"I've been a fan of using the app to check on my bank and credit card balances despite its odd quirks, but after the last update it's started becoming difficult to use.  Whenever I try to add a new cash transaction, half the time the app interrupts me when I'm almost done with some warning, or it inexplicably throws me back to the main screen.  I don't know what's up but the interaction with the cash transaction workflow should be modal, not interruptible.",0

145102,"It keeps alluding to ""bills"", but that isn't even a feature. There is simply no interface for tracking recurring bills. Confusing and disappointing. It'd be very useful. Other than that bit of false advertising, pretty good app for budgeting.",9
145103,I've been using mint for about three months now and all of a sudden it stopped updating my bank information like transactions and total amount in it. I use bank OZK I'm not sure if it's an issues on mints end or if my bank is to blame.,2

145105,"I have used this app for a long time, long before Intuit bought it.  Lately it has been a disappointment.  AT&T bills randomly do not show up, credit card payments being categorized as ""taxes"", multiple charges being shown, affecting my displayed balance even though such charges never happened.  In general, I can no longer trust it.  When contacting customer service, they suggest using the web site to correct these things.  Never once do they admit that they made a mistake.

(Updated to 5 stars after new UI rolled back)",4
145116,I used this app primarily for pre-market information however it's reporting and articles are left leaning (anti Trump/pro Biden) and I'm just not interested in supporting these companies anymore. Uninstalled after several years of use.,1
145117,Best. More things can be added like bulk deals. More updated hot news and more articles about future perceptions of the stocks needed for decision making. THANKS.,3
145118,Must have!!!,0
145119,Best app I own. User friendly and intelligent.,0
145120,Simple and easy. Passwords change on too many websites so quick that it is somewhat of a pain to keep all updated. But that is not a flaw of this app.,0
145121,Would be a good app but it's just a source of pump and dump schemes and it's annoying want to talk about the market and what companies are doing but discussion boards are full of bots and scam links. Yahoo needs to do thier part to authenticate users to avoid this nonsense. I am deleting the app.,0

145148,"The email alerts are not even close to being real time. For instance, you'll get a low balance alert a week after you go beyond your threshold.  In addition, I got a special offer for the 4th of July, on the 7th of July. This renders the alerts, and mint in general, more or less useless.",0
145149,Needs a better win/loss interface for tracking my actual investments and needs a widget. Would be great if the app let me do side by side comparisons.,0

145159,Good application,0
145160,"Splitting transactions is still clunky, 10 years later. How does it make sense to force me to add the transaction, then back out and search for it in my list of transactions so I can split it into separate budget categories? Splitting transactions should be one of the first things you're allowed to do when you add the transaction, and is common in other budget apps. After all, who shops only for one budget category at a time? Also, why are you advertising debt and credit cards?",0

There has always been small issues like duplicate entries and periodic inability to connect to accounts (mainly on the app and not the website). The latest issue has been it's inability to connect with my main bank/credit card account. I will give it one more week before I dump it altogether.,9
145167,User friendly. Features are comprehensive.,0
145168,Great app for keeping track of spending. I use it several times a week,0
145169,Tried multiple times to setup account. Never got the app to update/add account correctly.,0
145170,The new update is terrible.   I use to be able to open the app and see what was going on in the market.   Now the stories are old and not in chronological order if the are there at all.   Probably time to unistall.,2

145250,"Painless setup and very intuitive interface. Many online banking platforms have similar features. However Mint is fantastic for looking at you finances more holistically. Would recommend. The app does lack many features present in browsers, but does a good job at streamlining and giving you the ability to see things at a glance. It would be really great if the app let me create new categories or edit the rollover flag on budgets.",5
145251,"Excellent App, one stop shop for everything Financial related. Highly recommend to anyone keeping up with the world of trading!",2
145252,While I like a lot of features of this app the reason I decided not to go with it is because when it brings in all my transactions from my bank statement it cuts off after signature POS debit and I don't see the rest. so I have to go back to the original bank statement to see what it was for I really want to keep track of what I'm spending my money on,0
145253,It's simple and easy to use; organizing your financing has never been easier.,0

145259,This would be a good app without the blog feature. This cannot be turned off. It doesn't even look like there's a paid version with it off. I'm not interested in having other people political views forced down my throat while looking at account activity.,3
145260,"After a recent update all the links,help tabs and ads ceased to work. Can't continue to read full articles and no response from yahoo to any of my complaints.

145297,"Too much Yahoo stock news, disproportionate bearish editorialism and crackpot analysis.   Wish alerts opened to home screen. Nice to see DJIA and a few stocks/funds at a glance and then get to details quickly.   Stories have a lot of ads that are easily activated while scrolling. So I don't read them.",0

145310,Just great all around!! Thanks!,0
145311,This app used to be good. Now it sends me Weekly Summaries from the app even when Push Notifications is unchecked.

145313,Very good app.,0

145544,I redownloaded this after a while of not using it. Couldn't remember why and now I do. It's saying I haven't spent any money for the last two months.

145634,"The app has been increasingly inaccurate, and has recently been duplicating some transactions more than once. It sometimes sees transactions that are not on any bank statement, and completely miscalculates my subscriptions (it believes I am paying $19 a month to netflix when I am paying just shy of $10).

145705,"Ok, so it is cool to be able to add all my accuounts, but I have a mortgage that they classify as a credit card and there is no way to change it.  This means that my house is not able to be associated with this mortgage.  Even though the set up screen indicates that if the loan is not listed, you can add it later, this is not the case.  I find no way to link the mortgage with the property and no way to show that this mortgage is not a credit card.  Seems like it should be pretty easy for them to allow an entered property to be attached to a loan, but no.  The forums indicate that this has been an identified problem for at least 1 year, yet they still have not fixed this.  Pretty weak.  In the end this seems like a program that is using your info to market stuff to you and you to other companies, and they figure what they offer is good enough to get your info and they aren't fixing problems.",1

145951,A app crashes constantly on new phone with nougat.  App works well at times but needs constant refreshing to get stocklist to display correctly.,2
145952,Garbage. Bunch of scams they advertise to take your money,1

145957,"but since it was ""updated"" recently, the app is not as appealing and it's less user-friendly. Oh and by the way, it has crashed and had to be reloaded. I am in search of a better app to replace Mint. Update, I gave it a try but the app is still unreliable and won't update properly even when executed manually. Perhaps it works if you only have 1 account.  But then, what's the point?",3

145975,So after contacting customer support I found out that they removed the feature to keep your indicators and it may reset automatically. What a pathetic update. Do yahoo even think about User Experience? Bye Bye Yahoo Finance! Previous Review: Recently noticed that chart settings are being reset everyday automatically. Not sure what happened. Otherwise like this app.,1
145976,Not working properly now...alerts are notified before they hit target price. Kindly solve the bug asap,1
145977,Best free personal budgeting app. My only suggestion to improve would be to show a bar or line graph with monthly spending by category to show the trends month to month (right now only a donut graph is shown for a single month at a time only which makes it hard to figure out trends),0
145978,Does not sync with Wells Fargo sync and update accounts. Balances are always inaccurate. Tried this app again recently to see if the issues have been resolved but no over a year later still the same problem. Another year later with the same faulty app.. Not sure why I even bothered. Mint is really useless. App development promises fixes but after 4 YEARS of the same problems with updating accounts accurately are they REALLY doing anything? 🤔,2

146283,The best budgeting app there is. This app has really made me take a hard look at my spending so that I can make cutbacks where I need to. Probably the best tool I have to help pay off student loans,0
146284,I originally had Mint Bills and having to switch over. Didn't get past set up because you have to verify you're a human after adding every account...checking each box (and repeating the process if you mess up) is too time consuming.,0

I use this app daily to track all of my accounts and to help make sure no fraudulent charges appear on my cards. But, the app shows ""No upcoming bills due"" when all of my bills are paid for the month and If the date is the end of the month (like June 30th) it gives you a false sense of security as you may actually have a bill due in 1 day, causing a late payment!",0
146306,I using my TurboTax/ Intuit user ID and password could never login to Mint so I don't know whether it's going to impact my financial deal because I can't use the app because I can't login why not I can't find any information on why I can't log in so he gets up one star I would give it a no-star if that was what was there to rate so fix the login password stuff and I will rate you higher,6

146453,"Real time quotes are great, easy to use, ads are super unobtrusive, has a dark theme. Best app for keeping track of tsx, us stocks",0
146454,"Mostly positive, but I get alerts constantly about being close to exceeding budgets, which are not accurate. Maybe the app can't handle budgets where current spending is negative due to rollover from the prior month? The same notifications about upcoming bills also keep generating every day, after I've dismissed them. These two things make the whole notification tab basically useless for me.",27
146455,But why do you jeed access to my phone calls? Why do you need to be able to delete protected data according to the update?,0
146456,"Love the app overall - initially found it to receive price alerts at my personally set thresholds. But I can't get other push notification settings to stick. Every time i turn off the Editor's Picks notifications, they turn back on. (Android). I don't want to turn off all app notifications via my phone settings options because I still want to receive the price alerts. But how can I turn off the news alerts in a way such that it will stick!",186

146463,"I love this app- the whole service, really. It's easy to use and useful for keeping an eye on your finances when you're on the go. Still, there are some things with mint that you can only do on the computer, like set goals. It would be neat to be able to do that from my phone.",0

It also does a great job of letting you create budgets which is the main reason I got it. However, my primary complaints are an inability to get rid of or move sponsored deals (which I understand is how Mint is free, but I would love just a little bit more flexibility, even for a fee).

147128,Back to what I expect from the app. Thank you for listening to your customer feedback. Previous review: use to love this app but the changes are gearing it toward advertising. I liked having all the info right at your fingertips by scrolling on 1 page. now you have to page through multiple pages and click into things to get a total view of everything.

Any time this happens I have to manually calculate the new values and input a false buy/sell position to accurately reflect any gains/losses since open.",7
147138,Why is the widget limited to 8 tickers? Could it be possible to raise it? I know my phone can handle it just fine,2

147172,I'm Canadian and have used this app for years.

147183,"This app heavily depend on the selling of your information and ads to opperate. Since signing up, which I now regret, I have received an annoying number of calls, letters, and emails from other companies soliciting services. The company not only sells your info but injects ads into your normal information making it irritating to look at your finance info. I have since closed my account and hope the annoyances of using this service will disappear.",0

147199,Downloaded this app. Was planning on signing up. The next morning there was a charge for this app. Apparently they automatically charged me thru Google when I downloaded the app. So I now have a paid subscription for a service I never signed up for....nice. That's pretty dishonest. Now I won't use this app. I will look elsewhere if this is how they operate.,9

147221,"if you are Canadian, you can't add bills. Not even manual bill tracking to get an alert when they are coming due and manually input payments. How hard is it to sync a calendar inside the app? Calendars work in Canada. Also, it does a terrible job of labelling/categorizing transactions. if I wanted to spend hours categorizing transactions, I'd stick with a spreadsheet. if my CC or bank can label my transaction sensibly, why doesn't that info port over with the amounts?",1

147227,"I've been using mint for a while now and I have many great things to say about it as a whole. The app is incredibly user friendly, it has one of the simplest UI's I've ever seen. (It's also a super modern layout...which I love) It's interface is simple and for it being free...it has a lot of functionality. You often see apps that you have to pay for in order for it to be good...but with this one...YOU DONT! All around good app for all ages and all backgrounds.",63
147228,"Other apps may have snazzier UIs, but if you take the time to read the legal terms, you'll see they're all monetizing your data and reserving the right to sell it to others (in addition to trying to tie up your legal remedies). Intuit actually has fairly reasonable terms and has taken a rather protective stance toward user privacy, since financial information is so closely guarded. If you care about what companies are doing with your information, it's probably a wiser choice to go with Mint than the rest.",0

One of the features that I value is the budgeting, complements the purpose of this app. However, the new design update for Android makes it a bit harder for me to go to specific tabs. For example in the main page I have to swipe left/right to see budget or the menu on top, or gets confusing. Please considering adding this on bottom tabs or sidebars. Too many steps added now.",13

Finance account already imported and then put it in settings if I want to 
import another one. 1/30/2018 update: it couldn't be any slower or less

147351,"I've had this app since it was pageonce then it went to mint and now this new version of mint. I liked all the others even when they had minor changes but this app has went backwards in functionality & convenience. The accounts don't refresh accurately or have a manual refresh option. The screens are to busy and complicated to easily see things like the older version of mint. The advertising takes up a vast majority of the space, now I understand the app is partially funded by the selling of the advertising but it is supposed to be secondary to the actual app purpose & function but it is the focal point. If these things don't change I'll get another app instead. I hate to leave but I will this is how it's going to be cause it don't fit my needs or reasoning for getting it in the first place. Please review the old version of the app and adjust things back to being more similar to that.",3

147420,Has improved my awareness of my finances dramatically since 2015,0
147421,No integration or connectivity between Mint Bills and Mint.  I'm not a software engineer but it's like if an iPhone cannot communicate with an iwatch. What's the point?  I spent a good hour importing all of the bills and assets only to have to do so again.  Great idea but huge failure.,0

147431,Two big issues with this app. 1. Everytime this app updates it resets my screen lock. This is very frustrating because I don't always know when an update is downloaded so the app could be left unlocked and I would not know it. 2. Cannot do full text search. You can only search by predefined category. For example if I want to look up all my Walmart purchases i end up with partial results because every Walmart shows up with a different name/store number.,1

147503,Great app to read and to learn from. Love the ability to access charts on the go.,0
147504,I've had mint for ages because it consistently aggregates my data but this app is over simplified and nearly useless right now. Why can't I look at last month's budget? Why is it so hard to view last months spending? Why are there no tools for viewing trends? Such easy and crucial features are missing... How can a budget app with 10M downloads not include essential features.,7
147505,"I like the app and how it separates expenses it should have an edit though so you can put things in its proper category. I had $800 in fast food, but my groceries were also in that category. would be nice to be able to fine tune it yourself.",2

147525,"I have been a user of Pageonce that later became CheckMe then changed again to Check, and finally Mint Bills. Ever since Mint has taken over this great app has lost not gained any features. The UI crashes on many devices, as I have pushed many friends and family to use this app. I am absolutely disgusted in the poor decisions being made. We don't want a budgeting app full of crap, we want a simple app that can send us a push notification when our bills are due, and pay them easily without logging in to many different sites and entering in info repetitively. Like the old saying goes, if it isn't broke, don't fix it. You will not receive a good review from me. I have loaded all my bills via Chrome into my Mint account and when I load the app the bill pay option does not appear in my app. The pictures that are associated with the app in Google Play are not consistent with that of the app. This is frustrating. I am not a typical consumer, I will find another developer, or I will develop my own app for the market that craves for a simple, no gimmick, easy to use app that Pageonce, once was. And whoever is in charge of the reviews, stop copying and pasting responses. Its ridiculous.",2

147537,I've been using Mint for two weeks now. I do enjoy the app. Not saying that there isn't things it could improve on. However being a free app I think it's worth a 5 star rating.

147548,Love the program exactly what I wanted. Only thing I could see improving are two things. User custom categories to drill down better on spending. The other would be maybe a month to month cash flow. Income that doesn't show up until almost two weeks into the month can distort the monthly cash flow maybe adjoins months can reflect it better.,6

They're not super disruptive but do get in the way sometimes (they're fiscally relevant to you though, so at least there's that). Coupled with the web app, mint really helps keep my budget in check.

148700,Was great until they started serving autoplay video ads that disturb those around me when I try to check the markets on my phone. No I'm not about to pay to remove the ads for a simple Index check which is all I use it for. Guess I'll have to find another app to check market indexes.

148709,"Up until a month ago, I was satisfied using Mint, I found it quite useful. However, for the past month, I have experienced major inaccuracies with Mint's reporting of my bank accounts' balances. I use Chase Bank, and Mint has been reporting that it has a temporary error [issue] with Chase accounts. My interpretation (and tolerance) of ""temporary"" is one day or two, it is not a month. Because of these inaccuracies, I no longer find Mint to be useful and I have to Uninstall this useless App.",20
148710,Awesome for budgeting,0
148711,For some reason Intuit has put far more effort into creating a positive user experience for Apple users of Mint and has neglected their Android app graphics. Would be a wonderful app if they would design for everyone!,0
148712,This app is useful when trying to keep account of spending.,0
148713,That's the best app for traders,0
148714,i been rockin this app since Fenton's made Spiroval.,0

148723,new update doesn't work very well... budgets and prior month spending are all completely wrong. the layout is also much more difficult to navigate... not sure why they changed it from the previous version which was perfectly fine.,1
148724,Very good information around the world about stock markets,3
148725,I find it very useful in looking up the stock quotes. It's concise and updates nicely,2
148726,Very nice app!!,0
148727,The new mobile update is the worst thing to happen to this app since it was released,1
148728,I'm been using mint for 2 years now and this is the worst version since then. I use to analyze the cash flow of previous months but it seems now is impossible. And other thing is I prefer all the information in one single page instead to have to navigate for different views in order to see what i want. I hope you fix that and think better before make that kind of changes.,0
148729,"The graphs should have more detail,  they are too rough and  vague on small moves,  but overall it's good.",1

I've tried adding the URL, I've tried adding it manually, I've sent Mint the requested URL to have their team work on it. I've gotten nothing for over half a year. Otherwise a good app to monitor spending, but if you use a bank or credit union that isn't Wells Fargo, Citi, [INSERT BIG BANK NAME HERE], then don't bother.",1

I click the ""fix it"" button, log into my accounts but the app and website still fails to show current data.  I refresh and it says refreshed xx minutes ago but the data never changes. No one on the support team is monitoring the community board and therefore the majority of the issues have no resolutions. The same can be said for their Facebook page, all I saw were complaints with no response. Looking for a new app. Any one have any suggestions? This is the worse case of false advertising I've ever encountered.",1
148777,"This app is now atrocious. After multiple emails with support, the accounts are constantly loosing connection with the app, it's not updating the account information correctly, then layout of the app makes no sense. It's almost as of Intuit doesn't read any of these reviews! They're scathing. Poor attempt to copy Mint Bills which was almost flawless. UI confusing and accounts don't update accurately. I've been communicating with Mint about issues that they're very attentive but little is actually being fixed. After reading hundreds of reviews since Intuit is transitioning from Bills to just Mint, NOBODY is happy. Switch back! Why piss all these customers off!? They're jumping ship! So am I. I downloaded Prism.",14

There's a lot of features that exist on the website that aren't in the app (adding an asset like a house or car). There's no way to just budget savings - instead you have to create a goal which just doesnt work as nice as I'd like and there are some crazy assumptions for some that you can't change (eg saving for a house)",10

149040,This used to be a great resource for viewing after hours price changes in a list view format. Yahoo inexplicably removed this feature in their latest update:(...

I have used this app for years. Now it looks like it is time to move on. This is really a shame because this app used to have a great interface!,12

149075,I've used Mint for an iPhone and personally think that it's much better on IOS than on Android mainly due to the fact that you can create goals and choose when you want to accomplish your goal and it would automatically calculate how much you need to save or how long it would take you to save.

149206,I downloaded this app for like 2 times and it still won't b open I'm using Android,2
149207,Looks pretty and seems secure but it would be nice if you could customize the budget categories and such. It's just not what I need in a budgeting app.,2

149216,"Monthly subscription charges are not portrayed accurately on this app. I thought for a minute that I had to contact someone about how much they were now charging for their service, but I confirmed first that it's this app that's at fault for not noticing that sometimes there is a single subscription charge that sometimes falls on the 31st, and sometimes falls on the 1st. The app just sees it as a subscription charge for double its actual cost per month when it is not. Please fix this issue.",25

149231,Incredible! Keep doing what you guys are doing.,1
149232,The computer version of this app is much more robust and gives  me a lot more detail.  The version on my smartphone does not provide enough information so I often times go to other websites.,0
149233,Very useful to give a simple but complete view into your expenditures all in one app. Highly recommended for anyone struggling to budget.,0

149237,"This app, while useful for real-time stock and portfolio quotes, is FULL of 
awful deceptive ads. 4 out of 5 ""news updates"" or ""market alerts"" are

149239,"I love the minimalist look to the app as well as having an easy and secure way of adding your bank account(s) to the app. Creating budgets and adding bills, or creating manual ones, helps a lot in letting you know where you're spending and where you should be spending. I'll be using this to help in keep track of my student loans so I really do recommend it for students who really need something to help budget money.",11
149240,I really wish they would add search capability to the product category list so I don't have to scroll for miles.,0

149261,"the new update is terrible. boring generalized summaries (told me my budget was maxed when I have 200 left to spend, only realized when I scrolled down...are you trying to scare me??) and too many clicks and swipes to see relevant information. I don't care about my credit card rewards, I don't care about my savings (its on another app) and you can't customize what cards you swipe through. Not to mention the giant ads, I feel like the new UI doesn't care about users.",0

149289,I needed to follow my investments closely.. the Yahoo finance application did the trick.,0
149290,Why do they need to know phone id and your wifi connections.  DANGEROUS EXCESSIVE PERMISSIONS!,3
149291,I like to keep my personal net worth at a minimum and to watch that increase over time. Mint allows me to do just that. It helps keep my spending under control.,0
149292,The app would update and wipe out my saved lists unless I back up with a yahoo account.,1

149294,more of adds makes disturbing,0

149296,Great to keep all your accounts in one place and plan your budget.,0

149305,"There are always connection issues when I use the app. Reloads hang, my accounts need to be re-sync'd, and I have duplicate accounts that I can't seem to remove.

149307,I am loving the App.,0
149308,"I've just started using this and I like the idea of it a lot so far. the app itself has been annoying me, though. I'll order the items in the overview the way I want them, but then it goes back to the defaults the next time I open it.",1
149309,"I absolutely love the website, but both apparently for tablet n phone are really bad compared to the website. Especially the phone one, is just good for small adjustments but that's it. Needs way more features",0

149319,Buggy and to cluttered. I like this app over every other one that I've tried but you can just easily add loans on there that are in offline accounts and it show up. Lots of advertisements but it's also free. Needs some work.,0

149425,"This app doesn't seem to function properly with the Pixel XL. It seems that it continues to deploy in Tablet Mode removing the 'Bills' category. Switching your display size to small then to default may fix the issue, but hasn't for me.  This was a critical feature for me using 'Mint Bills'. Now I am considering alternatives. I just purchased the Samsung Galaxy 8 + and the same problem persists.  I still cannot view the bills section. It's been some time now and there still hasn't been a resolution. It's unfortunate. Please revert back to Mint Bills. I've had now 2 late payments already and now billers are  beginning to block the new Mint.

149543,Mint helped me pay off debts and control spending with goals. Development seems stagnant and not a lot of improvements over the years. Some features are lacking for adding accounts that can't be directly linked. The AI for tracking transactions seems to forget preferences and identified expenses so I have to fix the categories constantly.,1

149739,It paints a better picture of my finances when I put all the accounts together. BofA recommended this app a couple years back and I've been loving it. The fact that it does not make any transaction makes me feel safer with it,0
149740,"Pretty decent, can be difficult to link some accounts. Monthly cash flow doesn't allow you to see previous months, so it constantly looks like I'm spending way more than I earn because I get paid at the end of the month, so that's annoying.",2

149777,Everythings perfect,0
149778,"I like the application and find it very useful for getting quotes and quick industry news. My only complaint is that it requires that you rotate your phone for a graph of stock prices.  As someone who keeps auto rotation intentionally off on my phone, it is really annoying because I cannot see the graphs.  They should make a link to see the graph rather than requiring rotation, or at least offer both.",0
149779,I don't usually do reviews but I know Intuit is a good company since I am familiar with QuickBooks. So it is frustrating that I was unable to use this app because it wouldn't link to my bank account. I tried 4 times. Disappointing.,0

I don't want my savings involved with the monthly budget. is there a way it can only focus on my checking account and not my savings? I've tried deleting on of them but it doesn't allow that. but all of my monthly totals include the amount that is in my savings account which I do not want at all.  this would be 5 stars if you could pick and choose the accts you want.",0

149834,"Mint is ok on a daily usage level. It's nice to have all of your accounts updated in one place. But in terms of keeping a budget it's stupidly restrictive - you would think with today being August 1st, I would be able to see how I did with my budget in July. Not so. I can see how I did last week, which is useless to me, or I can see everything in an unorganized list. So basically, I still have to maintain my budget in an excel spreadsheet and only use this when I need to know if I can go big at Starbucks.",1

149875,Doesn't support all countries,0
149876,This app is great for young adults (or anyone really) who likes to keep their finances on track. You are able to see an overview of your overall cashflow and your spending.

149877,"Required repeated Price alert feature or option, currently we have only 'once ' not repeating option under Alert function..",66
149878,This system requires a bank account to even budget. We don't have a bank account we pay cash for everything. They are assuming everyone has a bank account and would willing give them access to it. It is incredibly foolish to give any company access to your bank account. If they get hacked there goes everything you have worked hard for.,0

That helped me stay organized better than only being able to manually enter each dollar spent. Wish this one would do the same.,1

149919,I have been a Mint user now for a few years and at first getting everything setup was hard but after using it for a few months it worked out well for me.,0
149920,"Really great to see theapp taking advantage of Android tablets! Delayed info fromaccounts seem to be on the banks' ends for the most part, not with mint. Working beautifully on the Galaxy Tab",1
149921,"Mint bills (which they are getting eid of) was perfect for me.  There is a lot of clutter to get through on the mint app. They need to either add or change the interface to match mint bills. I am giving this a shot, but may look for alternatives.",4
149922,The app is good and it will be better if you keep updating...,0
149923,Tous memo nescessaire pour etre au courant et alerte,1

149936,"Didn't like it at first but it's definitely gotten better so I've warmed up to it. Still has a ways to go but I'll give it a four star. Maybe 3.5, still not bad",0
149937,"Very practical, easy to use and keep me informed with latest market news",3
149938,up to the minute financial news at a glance!,0
149939,"Well, I liked it before it changed and combined with other Intuit products. In this day and age, I'm not interested in using one login to access everything. I felt better when the products were separate.",0
149940,"I've used the online tool for years and love it.  The app is helpful for quick budget checks, but doesn't replace the website.  I would like the ability to see my savings goals in the app.  Also, rollovers seem to mess up the total monthly budget.",0
149941,Nice and informative,0
149942,Why isn't there a page just for market news,0
149943,One of Yahoo's strengths.  And the app itself is good too.,0
149944,Your live streaming has stopped working since the last update.,0

149950,Simple and clear,0
149951,I can't believe I get this for free,0
149952,It shows all the economic events from the most important to the least important economic events,0
149953,Easy and quick way to to keep up with stocks .,0
149954,"The new app design seems sleek but to me it's taking many steps back. Two of the most annoying things: I don't want to see my 'net worth' pinned to the top all the time. In fact, please allow users to hide it under a few clicks. Secondly, I was able to see all the important items like recent transactions, budgets, etc by scrolling. Now it's a bunch of left swipes. It's unclear what each swipe will bring up. There is no way to predictably jump to, say, budgets. Please go back to your prev design",2
149955,Doesn't work,0
149956,Perfect for what i need and was looking for,1
149957,"Good app... Would rate 5 stars if it updated properly. It shows the most recent transaction, but the total doesn't reflect it.",0
149958,Edit: Account connections have remained stable. Really nice for keeping track of my financial activity. The only thing is my connected accounts and bills keep disconnecting.,0
149959,"Best app ever to manage expenses, budget, be on top of extraneous charges, makes you money!",0
149960,"Simple, works well on a Nexus 7 tablet. A great service for taking my finances!",0
149961,Overall good app but my main problem is not showing all current comment any product shows me last 3-4 months comments now. In the starting shows all current comment but now not show any current comment.pls solve this problem.,117
149962,"This is heads above every other market app I've used. Smooth, elegant and amazinglyhad real time futures..free. I have no idea how they managed that one, but I'm not asking any questions. I was happy to discover that turning the phone sideways gives you candlestick charts. Strangely, unless I missed something, there is no volume...I absolutely need that for this app to be truly valuable  to me. A couple of my most wanted features: 1) ability to draw trendlines and horizontal.  lines.2) add alerts if crossed",3
149963,I haven't been using it long but it seems to be wonderful for what I need. I do kinda wish I could more easily navigate transactions and plan multiple goals with a single account but overall an excellent app.,0
149964,This is certainly a good addition! Have been using it for last 3 years and hey the best thing its free and secure!,0
149965,No more receipts or paperwork piles it's nice.,0

149969,"Excellent, easy read!",0
149970,Provides what I need for monitoring my portfolio and related news.,0
149971,The app will no longer open after an update. It gets stuck on the opening page and just flashes the word loading and that's it.,0
149972,Not sure what I did before this app,0
149973,"I love having all of this information at my fingertips! I just wish it would let me categorize the transactions while they are still pending (that's when I still remember what the charge was for ;-)) Overall, it's much easier to stay on top of categorizing my transactions on my phone then the remembering to log on with my laptop. Thanks mint!",0
149974,Quicker than my other banking app.,0
149975,Yha sb kuch milta hai bhai,0
149976,Stay informed people,0
149977,"Great app for managing personal finances. Only complaint is that some mutual fund vendors dont allow integrations, but this is hardly Mints fault.",0
149978,It won't connect to one of my accounts and won't accept the password when I try to fix it. Just gives an error every time. How can I keep control of my finances if one important facet isn't being represented. The app is good otherwise. I just won't continue to use it.,0
149979,"Mint had really helped me get my budget under control and understand where my money is going. When I started using the service over five years ago, my credit score was in the toilet and my net worth was depressingly negative. Now my credit score is excellent, my cards are all paid off and my net worth is climbing all the time. It's really an excellent tool if you're serious about getting your finances under control.",6
149980,"Was great until a few days ago. Now I open up the app and get a blank screen - no markets, no stocks, nothing.",2
149981,Great app for tracking all your expenses. I dislike the ads but everything else in this app is useful. Sometimes account connections break but support is good about fixing them.,0
149982,Great way to plan where you want your money to go! I highly recommend this app!,0
149983,its nice to being here....,0

149993,So many reason,0
149994,"Good in theory - used to work flawless but now one huge broken app. Transactions randomly double, amounts never right, sync errors. Cant edit accounts",0
149995,Takes the info from all my accounts and combines it into one easy to use app. Categorize spending and create budgets. Mint will warn you if you are over budget or if it sees unusual spending. Great app!,1
149996,constant battery drain warnings popping up,0
149997,it says it updated the accounts but it didnt... does not reflect the true balances... but overall this is an awesome app...,0
149998,"I have been using this app for a few years now one of the biggest reason is the company behind it and the level of security I expect from them, when you put all your financial information on a platform you at least want to have some confident in the company behind it. one of my biggest frustration with this application is duplicate transduction whenever this happened my entire overview is completely wrong because it calculate one transaction twice therefore leaving me with incorrect number.",0
149999,Unable to create account,0
150000,Keep getting logged out all the time. It is not useful user experience,0

150005,"Very good app for trading,,,,,,",0
150006,This app is always on time and it's very accurate.,0
150007,Am getting good information to trade,1
150008,I have gotten a lot better grasp on my spending. I'd give it five stars if the app had an auto budget feature once they get a grasp on your monthly income average.,0
150009,Love this app that helps me to keep the full financial picture together,0
150010,Not the most useful,0
150011,"Plays hulu perfect. The commercials, not so much. I freeze up on a black hulu commercial screen more often than not. Fix that and this is 5 star worthy. Htc rezound.",0
150012,Force closes everytime. Its the perfect app for my needs. If it is fixed I'll definitely download it. Until then it's just useless!,1

150026,But please remove ads at the bottom. I'm willing to pay $1 for no ads. Thanks. Also nice to have is to backup portfolio to sd card incase one needs to switch phones or install again. It will save time. So 4 stars only.,0
150027,Nice app. One problem: My mortgage is weekly. Mint won't handle weekly recurring expenses.,1
150028,I would like to have the option to see previous month's spending...it would be nice to compare spending habits from month to month.,0
150029,"The only thing that would make it better is if the transaction categories were memorized by the app. For example, a venmo payment is almost always entertainment for me, but if i change it, it just says transfer on the next venmo transaction. Everything else is great.",0
150030,Self employed,0
150031,"Discovered this app two weeks ago, and I was going to rate this app 5 stars because i loved it so much, infact i told everyone that cared to listen about it and recommended it....so its very disappointing how it turned out to be, since monday this week everything started to go wrong...the live updates are so slow, very wrong technical summaries andforecasts!

150035,I love the app and all the features,0
150036,I don't find it amusing to open my finance app to discover it force closing. I would imagine that this sort of behavior could leave three zip open to a security breach or hack attempt. Consider yourselves on notice. Your customers will be abandoning you if they see too much more of this sort of nonsense happening.,0
150037,great app even without any cost or paid v.,2
150038,Kenya is happy 😄🌟🎉,0
150039,"Works good,I like the variety of view customizations available.",0

150047,to find what you want,0
150048,"Awesome app, probably one of the best financial market app on Android! An paid ad free version is seriously needed though! Is there a set of widgets planned in the roadmap of future versions?

150049,Excellent app,1
150050,"Great app. Only thing I would add is a stock screener. The feature is available on the website, so it should also be available on the app.",0

150061,All your finances in one place. So much better than using 15 different apps and you get to see the big picture.,0
150062,Basically keeps me up to date with my bills and cash flow. Budget option is great to just use as a reminder to how much I should use for the rest of the month (or tell the next pay day lol),0
150063,Fails to connect accounts,2

150065,It is a great overview and aid in checking my finances.,0

150069,Oh yah paid media . Never tell the truth .,0
150070,Although it is a great app for trading but real time news is still lacking. Mostly the news pops up after some big moves and then the explanation is given. No predictions based on analysis,19
150071,app is so helpful to keep track of all bills,0
150072,"I love this app.  It gives you the news, just the facts.  Also,  it has no bugs.",1

150087,Great fr Cfas,0
150088,I'm so disappointed that Mint Bills is going away. Time to find a new app I guess. I have an account with Mint and I don't find it reliable. I'm still getting bill payment reminders from accounts I closed years ago.,1
150089,"Super, but news comes after the visibility of effect caused by an event. News to be a news not a report.",1
150090,"Constant popup that the app is not responding, the app works for the few seconds between popups but it is too annoying to be useable",0
150091,just connects you to happenings in the market with analytical eyes,0
150092,It would be decent if it worked consistently but it crashes frequently and is completely unreliable...it's easier to use yahoo finance full website on my phone with more features than this app.,4
150093,Needs a delete account option for tablets. Asus transformer.,0
150094,Been using Mint for quite some time and have always found it useful.  My only gripe is not being able to change the amount of an 'Other Property' through the app. Please enable this and definite 5 star!,1
150095,It keeps me informed.,0
150096,Love the concept... has quite a few glitches... but it's still useful,0
150097,"Even though I've never used this app I guess I have a account thanks to turbo tax, resets password because I don't remember what it was, try logging in with password I just changed it to, couldn't get in. Try on their website, works right away. Repeat this 3 times before the app just locking me out for 15 min and then when I try logging in again an hour later states it's still locked out for 1 more min. Wait 5 min and try, states its locked 15 min again, giving up and looking for another app.",1
150098,"The app won't update my bank account, and it's been 3 days since my last deposit. It's a bit annoying.",0

150104,Best Bill tracker ever. 😊,0
150105,"Good for tracking expenses and budgeting, but needs dedication to link accounts continuously. Also doesn't necessarily automatically recognizes a type of expense. Once the expense is setup in the system you might need to fix it over and over again every month.",0

150119,"Great apparently, way better than trying to use the browser for quick access and screen navigation is simple and intuitive.",0
150120,Great app only issue is why the max time option on the stock chart isn't available on the mobile version? On browser and tablet there's 1 day up to max but mobile stops at 5 years for some reason,0
150121,Updated: the November 2012 update makes mint for android 10 times better.Therefore I have changed from 2 to 4 stars.Android is not inferior to iOS so its time developers give all apps streamlined interfaces.,0
150122,So far so good and I'll update as time goes on.,0
150123,Not helpful for budgeting. They don't break down expenses by category. Not helpful for me,0
150124,"Unlike other finance apps where all your income and spendings have to be manually inputted, mint goes the extra mile and does all the work for you...",0
150125,It's a great way to budget your money and the app works perfectly for me.,0

150139,why did widget disappear with the new Android 10 update?,1
150140,"Unexpected error messages? First, ignore Yahoo, boggles the mind they didn't figure this out. Their email goes nowhere and their options don't seem to help anyone including me. I wondered if this was a database issue from Dec update and it appears to be. Could possibly download your portfolios to excel, delete everything, wipe the cache, delete the app and reload. Having mine on several Android and desktop locations, I feared retaining data, so deleted all & setup under different email. WORKS!",18
150141,Hate it. Loved it as Mint Bills this format sucks constantly having to reenter cc info for whatever reason,1

150149,Won't connect to any account complete Miss representation a function,0
150150,Pretty good app thats helps with financing. I wish it had more bank links than what is on the list.,3

150158,Easy to use and useful tools,0
150159,Good information. Worth a read.,0
150160,Used to be a fantastic app but has really deteriorated in performance. It has been unable to sync with one of my key accounts for the past 3 months. Support was only able to tell me that it's a known problem but did not have an idea for when it would be resolved.,0
150161,"I use the mint app as a quick and reliable overview for my accounts. Although it doesn't have all of the tools as mint online, I use the mint app weekly.",0
150162,Good finance app but it needs to improve realtime stock prices and charts. Im using it for few weeks now and always struggle with correct stock pricing update. 20 mins delayed most of the time. Lot of things could already happened in the market.,0
150163,Mint has really helped me visualize my budget but it's missing some extra features id like. 1) to change the window of the budget maybe I want it to run 15th to 15th to line up with may CC or paycheck. 2) month to month I'd like to know overall how much I under (I.e. my budget says I'll save 600 I'm a month 7200 in. A year how far or close am I to that goal),1
150164,Great way to track all of my investments.,0
150165,The app is not user friendly especially for someone who is new to budgeting.,3
150166,Don't like the heavy data mining vibes.,0
150167,Biased news and alerts don't even work. Switched to yahoo finance seems better,5

150179,Useful n friendly app,0
150180,One of the best. Thank you,0
150181,"After every update the app shows a ""what's new"" message even though it's been the same message for the last five updates... Also it tends to rotate for no apparent reason, which is annoying. Apart from that, good app for stock tracking",15
150182,"The app truly needs all the features of the website, especially since the site won't load properly on a mobile.",1
150183,Good chanel app,0

150187,sunshine1176,0
150188,Great app...but today it told me ELON which is a stock I'm following went up 900+%.  That is false.  It was a reverse split not taken into account.  This is a serious flaw.  Stock price percentage gain is NOT simply yesterday's closing price relative to the current price.  Please fix this!,0
150189,Easy to consolidate all you credit cards and bank accounts into one view so you can see how you are spending your money. Setup was too easy. Only wish that it had alerts for when my payments are due. Another problem is that the budget slider is kind of annoying to set. Maybe it can be switched to a clicker or input box? Amazing app!,0
150190,Great management app,0
150191,Very good app the new update works even better very good for tracking stocks and making portfolios,0
150192,"Simply fantastic.  5 stars in my opinion.  I've been using Mint for nearly 18 months now.  From what I can tell, it's been over 6 months since they apparently fixed the intermittent syncing issue I mentioned in my earlier, 4 star review.  Me:  Moto Droid Razr Maxx with Android 4.3 'Jellybean.""",1
150193,Very useful.  Up to date at the time I need to use it.,0

150196,"Having a lot of issues syncing lately with my bank account.  I've tired everything I can think of.  When this app works it's good,  but also has issues duplicating transactions.  Every once in a while I have to go through and look for them and delete them.  Please fix these issues.",0
150197,"I have to revise my review because I can no longer see my monthly spending in a certain catagory over the year. You need to go into each month (several clicks) then write down the number. I'm not sure why they changed the interface, but no more birds eye view that made it so useful. Mint has a very intuitive interface and makes it so easy for me to get a high level view of my finances. I love it!",29
150198,Very good experience and app tell all data u need,2
150199,Like the app very much. Sometimes though when looking at articles the PDF is a little wonky and it takes some time to come up,0
150200,"Where's my portfolio? You're kidding, right?",4

150206,"Today 14th Oct 2021 suddenly investing Apps started crashing unexpectedly, I clear cache, reinstall apps and rebooted phone, but problem didn't got fixed. UPDATE: Quick response from investor tech support was great their suggestion didn't fixed my issue, but after couples of hours the apps started working fine, thanks for the help investor",2
150207,I can't customize my budgets? I don't need a coffee budget! Also it didn't transfer over any of my bills from my bank account so I manually enter and then it messes up my account balance. And won't let me look at previous month budget even though it has my bank info.,0
150208,All my accounts available at close to real time.,0

150215,Worked great until the update! Wish there was a easy to get the old app back! Other than that it is AMAZING!,0
150216,Gives you a quick snapshot,0
150217,"Occasionally, my bank's security will cut off updates, and the app won't let me know. It's fine if you use the website a lot, I guess.",2
150218,New update closes randomly and will not reopen. At all. The screen flashes once and the app crashes. Please fix.,3

150223,"Overall it's a decent app. But after turning off push notifications, I still kept receiving Breaking News notifications about once every 30 minutes. Can't figure out how to stop them so it was uninstalled.",1
150224,Instant uninstall. The developer has cut off half the market by only supporting American and Canadian personal finance.,1
150225,Fantastic App.,0
150226,Great app that lets me stay on top of all of my financial accounts. The reason it gets 3 stars instead of 5 is because after years and years there's still no dark mode on the app. In 2021 this is borderline unacceptable as dark mode is common across most popular interfaces. If dark mode is implemented this would be a 5 star app.,10
150227,easiest to read/follow stock tracking app,0
150228,The only issue is my past due bills disappear and i can no longer see them. That causes me to forget about them. Please update and i will give 5 stars.,0
150229,Cant manually add transaction!!! Fix this and its 5 stars.,0
150230,The app just redirects you to third parties . It does not give you the option to delete your account and they give your phone numbers and email to third parties and you get harrassed by third party sales people,0

150232,Crashes on opening. Before was good,3
150233,I logged out of the app and then tried to get back in. Forgot my password and followed the link on my email but it would never work. Tried for over a week from my phone and desktop. Would not recommend.,0
150234,Great app... Very helpful to observe world market.,0
150235,Reference about 3 times daily. Individual stock news should be kept more up to date. Would like to have options enabling sorting stock list alphabetically and by gain/loss would be a plus. Stock chart view normally limits my view to max 5 days. Not good.,8
150236,Easy to use.,0
150237,"Very smooth, just a pain to set up everything, but I don't think it's mints fault",0
150238,"Easy, straight forward app.",0
150239,Such a disappointment. We're being forced to switch from mint bills and it won't add my bills. After many years of using the original checks app I will have to look for another reliable app.,15

150266,"What would make it 5 stars is WITH PERMISSION the, accounts under his name are added in. I can never get a full look at our standing as a few accounts are in his name. I'm authorized on his. He is authorized on mine. We often use the others cards, drive each other's card. Etc. We'd both have to look it up to see which is which. If there were any unhappy parting or worries, it could be so easy to remove your accounts from the pairing. Other than that I LOVE IT! Everything I'd want.",0
150267,"Great app for a quick status check, as long as that is all you need. It doesn't provide more in depth info.",0
150268,Takes forever to update stocks. Not clear when a stock price is old or new (UI fix!). Doesn't update in the background. Super Slow.,1
150269,Excellent application,0
150270,"All accounts now show up, even closed accounts. This needs to be fixed on the Android version.",4
150271,"I feel this is a scam. when trying to delete my account it asks me to login my email and password to continue to delete. fair enough, only when done the Delete bar disappears and Mint welcomes me back. I am still waiting to be contacted back by support. until this is fixed beware before purchasing",15
150272,Makes it easy to keep up with things,0
150273,Swift experience and access to real time data and news . Notifications can be annoying but they're controllable. Avoid the comments section coz most people there are low IQ,0

150286,Missed my budgeted dollar amt and home value by 50% each then corrected itself after 3 days.  I feel absolutely robbed. Pen and paper would never let you down like this. I am broken. I went from hopeful to hopeless.,0
150287,very useful app,0
150288,"Rating 3 stars as v4.9.0.84 has taken a step back in usability: (i) values are rounded in the overview & account list (I'd prefer exact values to the cent on all screens); (ii) closed accounts are showing up; (iii) it's unclear if accounts are in the process of refreshing or not (prior versions showed the 'busy moving circle'). Otherwise, a 4 star app that reflects most functionality from the webpage. [11-Aug] Confirmed over the past 3 days that refresh/update function is indeed broken.",7
150289,Would not allow me to answer my bank's security questions. And I was looking forward to using this app!,0

150389,Best app I've found for markets on Android thus far even if Yahoo is not my desktop preference.,0
150390,"What was once a good app, is now a far cry from the days of being a clean, simple and functional mobile budgeting application. As more updates occur, the more the ads become more intrusive and the less user-friendly this app becomes. With the most recent update, it has completely axed functionality in favor of peddling affiliate links and basically forces users like me to downgrade to an actual functional version. Please reevaluate the leader of this project and their quality of work lol",3
150391,Actually  it can't update data in time. It is interesting my internet connection is so speedy but this app always delays data. So i don't use it any more. But if they solve that major issue i will give them 5 stars,3

Stash and M1 Finance are others specifically, more and more people are using those apps and it would be nice to consolidate all in one spot. I apologise for the 2* but the feedback area is also lacking.",5

150409,Always good accurate information,3
150410,This app had been suggested by my financial advisor. The first step was to enter my accounts including login and passwords  (which I was VERY reluctant to do). I tried to enter 2 of them but the app couldn't connect to either one. When I tried to move on to the next step it wouldn't let me without account information. My paranoia kicked in and I deleted the app.,0

150412,just needs a calculator,0
150413,Thank you!!,0
150414,keeps me on schedule. constantly logging into account that should be saved is quite annoying. categories can use some fine tuning. should be a 5 star app in no time,0
150415,No problems it keeps me informed,0
150416,I litterally cant trade I press trade and it sends me to an etoro webpage. And I pressed it a good 30 times. I litterally have 30+ chrome tabs open. Screw this app. I'll just use an app I can actually trade on,0
150417,I like the dark mode...totally awsome.,0
150418,Only USA and Canada it seems.,0

150426,"Mint has been a great tool for keeping track of my finances. I wish it allowed for more control over spending comparisons though. Comparing this month to last month is useful, but less so of you know your spending was abnormal in a given month. I also get alerts for high spending when I pay my mortgage, which is kind of annoying.",6
150427,"Great spot to have all your accounts in one place, but the app has become cluttered and slow as the developers keep adding unnecessary features. I liked it better when the app had one propose and did it well a year or more ago.",4
150428,Saving money is awesome!,0
150429,Have been using Mint for years to keep track of money; it can get a little confused if you keep transferring money between accounts to pay loans/credit card bills/etc. I use a spreadsheet to plan my expenses and Mint to keep track of where my money is going.

150461,The new updates are terrible. Everytime they update the app my account doesn't work and I have to reset it.,1

150489,The portfolio feature is awesome. So are the news and stock information.,0
150490,"The old Bills app that was bought from Check Inc and subsequently discontinued was a much better application for managing bills. It was a more stable application. The new application keeps locking out one account (causing my 1st late fee in years) and has trouble linking others. After spending all my time to move my accounts over, I may now need to do it all over again with another app. So sad that Intuit took what was once a top of the line application (Pageonce/Check) and eradicated it for this mess that is hard to navigate and even harder to manage accounts. EDIT: I have started migrating to Prism as my accounts keep getting locked out and/or disconnected in Mint. Intuit also seems to not care as they failed to reply to my comment or email.",3
150491,This would be a great financial  tool if it ever worked. I've sent tech emails to fix my accounts but no response. I need something that will update my accounts daily not every other week. Maybe I'll come back and use it when they get the bugs out.,0

150522,Probably one of the best apps to get your finances in order.,0
150523,5 stars but I can't categorize transactions for days until they come through. It makes no sense. If the transaction doesn't go through then what does it matter if it is for gas or groceries?,0
150524,"I'm missing the ability to include all asset queries in the portfolio, not just stocks. Like I can query XAUUSD=X on the website to get gold in dollars, but the app only allows for stocks.

150534,"my wife and i have used a lot if different budgeting apps. What attracted us to this one is the auto updating. However, while we have been pleased with just about everything, we are finding ourselves extremely limited in what we can make budgets for. Once this is fixed and we can make our own categories and subcategories we will definitely give this app a 5 star rating",0
150535,"The best financial tracking app though It could be better if you could set a budget for 1 year and set each month at any time (in advance) as well as they separated checkings as one category and saving as another, and have roll over budgets so if I want to spend 20 a month on garden then I don't spend it one month have 40 next month,",5

150589,"I was using the app for crypto and it worked great. This app, however, is way too slow. I always get ""slow connection"" or ""no connection"" alerts which is strange because everything else works fine. This is quite unfortunate. It's made even worse by the fact that apps can load while I still get ""no connection"" alerts. Quite saddening considering how much potential this had.",348
150590,"Works well in general and support is helpful,  though would like a way to hide duplicate entries in the mobile app.  Also, auto categorizing algorithm could get refined with different regular transactions to/from same institutions - i.e. auto vs. home insurance or bonus vs. salary income.",0

The app version is definitely more user friendly than the browser, but I would recommend setting up your initial accounts and budget categories in the browser.

150875,Useless anywhere else. Please add the UK for more stars.,0
150876,This app is incredible! Every update that comes through is just well thought out and integrates well into the already seemless app!

It hasn't updated some of my accounts in weeks! There's no error on these accounts, it's just not pulling info! Fix this!",33

With this being said.. mint is invaluable to me! Mint has made money management a piece of cake! I love it!,1

151195,"Soon after I opened my Mint account I received an email from them saying (incorrectly) ""It looks like you stopped contributing to your 401(k)"" and touting roll-over accounts. It contained the account name and balance, something the financial institution would never send in an email, much less an unsolicited one. Another privacy concern is that it takes 5 steps to logout. The app installed on  my Android phone and tablet without any problem. I found the UI rather confusing, especially on the phone version. I set up the connections to my credit union, 401(k), and several Vanguard accounts without much trouble. Like its corporate cousin Quicken, Mint doesn't properly handle transactions on my Vanguard debit card, which I use for most purchases.",0

151213,Every time while in a news article the add flashes and disappears on the screen restarting the news article from the beginning (top). This would be fine if it only happens once but it happens about every 5-10 seconds making news articles unreadable. Then add pops up and disappears so fast you can't close it in time.

151330,Can you pls include commodity prices also. Thanks,0
151331,Great to have.,0
151332,It would be great to add functionality to the portfolio tracker for a cash balance. It would help better track the overall portfolio rather than just actively owned securities. I.e. you set a cash balance that adjusts up and down (net value) when you mark that you've sold or bought a security from your portfolio watchlist. Option to allow adjustments for additional cash deposits/withdraws,0

151443,Excellent for tracking income and expenses. Update 12/20: Still using Mint for tracking finances. NO issues at all.,0
151444,Required that I update my password due to their new policy. Requiring me to create a password with upper and lower case characters and a symbol and a number does not significantly increase my safety against someone brute force guessing my password. Let me use a LONG password that I don't mind typing on a mobile device.,0
151445,Good real time tool and it keeps up with my stocks and allows virtual portfolio so my kids can pretend to invest a get a sense of how it works to invest,1

151474,Perfect for rounding all your accounts up and keeping the banking and investing!!!,0
151475,Used mint bills/check/pageonce on my iPad and android phone for many years.  After they closed Mint bills and told me to download this app i have had nothing but problems.  accounts keep asking to reenter all my security answers and locking me out of my online accounts.  The iPad app is even worse. They did not integrate any of the old mint bill features like the bill calendar to see all your bills in one place.  The android app has more features but they both have the same issues with linking accounts and keeping them linked. Can I just pay to use the old mint bills??,3

151486,"Mostly Fantastic app for about 4 minutes. Then it gets so slow you can't use it! On a midrange phone with 8 cores and 3gb ram & fast 4g it should be snappy! If you star lots of stocks, it takes 40sec to star a stock! Someone give the dev's a 2gb 4core phone and make them use it for 30 minutes. They will strip out the useless eye candy animations because it will make them scream.",0
151487,Great way to show you EXACTLY where your money goes. I just wish it let you set your own budget instead of basing it on the ballance of your bank account.,0

Why are all my bills? Where are the rest of the settings? Now in Accounts, you used to add online & manual bills. Nope only bank and bank transactions. Notifications is gone - this is a deal breaker for me. My budget has correct amounts but no names. Galaxy z fold 3 5g",4
151498,Superb site,0
151499,How can I draw support & resistance lines ?,1
151500,What a piece of junk. The spam emails are constant you get several every day. You can turn off emails and they still spam you daily. Even if you uninstall the app you still get spammed. Spam spam spam.,2
151501,Works very well. Never any problems,0
151502,"Perfectly good app ruined by an ""update"". The ads are bad enough, but all the news is now from Canada no matter how many times I set the Region to USA. And the worthless Canadian news isn't even on the home page. Ugh!!!",3

151510,Its search function is much poorer compared to that of Yahoo Finance website.,0
151511,The usefulness of the app was destroyed by this UI update. I dont know how anyone could've thought this design was good enough to even show their boss let alone get it approved and deployed. This reeks of inexperienced middle managers and bean counters trying to jam as many add views as possible.,6
151512,"Even without ads it would be terrible. Obviously a cash cow just trying to get screen time, always crashing and slow and they make you sign up so they can send you useless emails",11
151513,First time using the app was fine. After closing the app and trying to reopen it however it will no longer load my account. I click on my account to sign in and it just gets stuck loading for 15min (I gave up after that amount of time) and has happened everytime since. The website on the computer works fine luckily,0

151525,"Please let users decide if they wish to use the app in landscape or portrait mode. Loved landscape mode for the app on my iPad. Even though its a 7inch form factor landscape mode would work great esp. Great app otherwise, one of the best for android, 5 starts",0
151526,Why are you required to provide a phone number just to create an account? Uninstalled before I could even try the app.,0
151527,"So frustrating. I set up budget but can't see it for previous month. All my accounts have been added but have a few days or weeks delay in showing up in the app which defeats the purpose of having the app. Great app in theory, clearly not helpful in reality.",1
151528,I'm marking this as 1 star to get your attention. Since the latest uodate my upcoming bills are no longer reflected on the app or website. It says $0 due and when I click on bills it onlu shows me bills I've paid in the past. I attempted to reach you by customer support methods but the only method is the chat function which is never available. At this point this service doesn't function. Please contact me with methods to troubleshoot or I'll have to switch to another developer.,132

151531,I loved it at first but now it doesn't keep me logged in anywhere and it seems like some bills just disappear. The new-ish home screen leaves a lot to be desired as I'm never sure how to just get to a list of my bills. Super disappointing.,3

151697,I've really enjoyed this app and working with Mint for years but unfortunately they have taken away too many features. I used to be able to run my account through the app but it's less functional now. If it's not broke don't fix it.,0

151708,Best financial tracking app out there.,0

151718,"the web is faster than the android app. It's so usefull. but still missing things. like to make an alert being able to see previous alerts for that ticker, be lightier by choose. It's better with this last version improved. However I need to see, when I'm setting an alert, some previous alerts already defined. And If the price is going Up or Down. 👍👌",8

151721,Really liked it but it keeps categorizing my housekeeping services to shopping and it would be awesome if there was a way to permanently change that.,0
151722,"The best out there. Connects to all your accounts, even lets you log your car, and it occasionally updates its estimated value from KBB. Would be nice if it looked up motorcycles, too. Cons: their system of renaming merchants blows. You make a rule and it doesn't stick. Then 6 months later you find out it's applying to some other random. It tries to guess the category of a merchant, and it's accurate most of the time. But you can't fix it when it's wrong, because it's tied to the renaming thing.",9
151723,"Excellent app for quickly managing multiple accounts. My only complaint is you cant set a residual expense to always show up in the category you want, you can change each transaction manually though. Overall it is fantastic.",0
151724,Helps me keep a close eye on my spending,0
151725,"The app doesn't keep real time info on my checking account, so it's not a very reliable source for checking my available balance. It will do things like alert me of a ""large deposit"" a week after a deposit has posted. Now I'm all excited like I just got a bunch of money only to find out that it's referring to last week's deposit, which is usually already spent.  It would also be nice to have a calendar view of bill reminders etc.",0
151726,Keeps track of all your finances with the push of a button.,0

151738,Excellent apps!,0
151739,"The app is easy to use, I am trying to get used to something more automated than Excel. Don't like: I have one CC that won't synch (bank restrictions), so can't track those charges easily; can't plan my bonus as a 1 time income, it's forcing it to be monthly; I can't plan my income monthly, I get paid bi-weekly, so 2 months a year I get 1 extra paycheck; I can only see this month's budget, want to see whole year.

151752,It's the best personal financial app I've tried. Really love it!!,0
151753,It's unfortunate that it's not as useful as the webite. I can't hide accounts or cards which just ends up making everything inaccurate.,0
151754,"This used to be a quality app. It is now very slow to update. They have also messed up my rollover budgets to the point where it is unusable. I reached out to support and they said the solution was to either continue to use roll-over to calculate your infrequent large expenditures, or remove the roll-over feature to have an accurate budget number. This defeats the purpose of the app and is very disappointing.",58
151755,"In the ""Quotes"" section, why am I forced to see YHOO, MSFT, and AMZN quotes all the time?  Not only that, these three quotes are always at the top no matter whether I'm interested in them or not.",0

151781,Great for tracking expenses and setting goals!,0
151782,I really like this app but just found out that when you record notes on a pending transaction that they get erased when the transaction is not pending anymore. I can't tell you how incredibly frustrating this is to have spent hours putting important notes in pending transactions just to find out that they've been erased.if you're not going to keep the notes why do you let us put it there in the first place?,19
151783,Not as good as Yahoo stock widget.  Bring back the widget.,1
151784,"Used to work well, nice and clean UI.    But now... They have implemented ads.  Very,  very annoying ads.      Enough for me to use a rivals finance app.      Thanks,  but no thanks Yahoo -  Uninstalled.",4

151793,Nice app. Love u yahoo finance.,1
151794,Mint seems to have several different tools to help manage finance. I like the interface and colors. One drawback so far is that the app doesn't seem to be keeping pace with my paychecks.,0
151795,"I had an iPhone and used Mint app...a few years later, I used this app again on my cell (Droid Motorola RAZR M)...it's what I expected...it allowed me to categorize transactions, so I can look later at certain features that are only on full website version",0

151801,"Combines all accounts into one, but sometimes it's not 100% accurate. I've also had problems with it not reporting paid off trades. I paid off a trade and it still showed a balance.

It may reflect the overall balance, but sometimes must log into website to get a true picture.",1

151812,I love Mint and I've used it for years. Now it won't even open. It crashes immediately upon opening and will do so until randomly working briefly. Unusable in it's current state.,0
151813,A great and easy to use app for managing expenses! The only thing that i wish this app did was to make the transaction history a little bit more immediate. It seems to refresh every few days so im not entirely sure what i have left in my budget until then.,0
151814,forgot to hit the stars. awesome app.,0
151815,"Up, Down, Sideways. Sometimes its a fickle beast. But you don't have to miss the latest & greatest financial news. Not with this app. Only downside is excessive news about Yahoo itself, which a wise man might say, add some salt before eating or you could get a tummy ache. Wouldn't touch that stock with a 10 foot pole. But then again, Yahoo could use all the help it can get, so what if they do a little self promotion on their own app, right?",0

151855,The new format implemented recently is a great improvement. Much easier to see and the layout is great.,0
151856,I've been using this for years at some point in the last year PayPal required me to verify everytime I wanted an updated of my balances. This was very annoying until recently that verification process broke entirely. You can't add real property on the app either which is annoying as I own some vehicles out right at this point and can't include those as part of my assets without going to the desktop site. I used to recommend this app but it's getting harder as time goes on.,2
151857,"I really do love this app! It helps me keep from over spending, and remember what bills still need paid. But it would be nice to be to add our own little sections of Budgets. Like, Wedding!  I am currently planning one! And for charity, specify who or what it it to.",4

151876,I used Mint 15 years ago and liked it. I was excited to download the app and use it again but it will not let me sign in. I have gone thru all the password reset stuff and I still can't log in. Finally figured out the account has been deleted which is fine but when I try to set up a new account I'm told that my email address is already in use as an ID. So I cannot use this app because my account was deleted but my email address is still in use as an ID?! There is a problem somewhere and No link to request help other then resetting the password. Really disappointed.,7

The new summary pages are far less useful than the old interface. They require a lot of horizontal scrolling and extra clicks to get to useful information. The summary page for budgets doesn't even do math correctly. The morons responsible for this redesign should be ashamed of themselves.",63

151985,Its nice to be able to check all your balances quickly without involved sign ins.,0
151986,"The app itself is pretty good, however the widget options disappoint me. Can we get a widget that shows your spending so far on your budget? Either your overall spent/budgeted or scrolling and broken down by each category. That's one of the biggest reasons why I downloaded and I'd love to be able to glance at how I'm doing throughout the instead of having to open the app every time.",4

151994,GOOD service,0
151995,Love Mint since my first review it's really kept getting better and better. The ability to see my bills remind me of my bills and being able to pay from the app has been a God send. The only problem Mint has it doesn't let you easily add cash(as in not in a bank account) and it doesn't factor it in to you totals.,2

151997,It's scary to know where every dime goes but great to keep yourself in control. Very  easy to use,0

152034,Even when I refresh it still does not reflect what is actually in my account. It's usually off by a few hundred.,0
152035,I've used this app for quite awhile and found it quite useful but the number of ads inserted into the news feed makes it a pain to use along with the number of news sites that don't go directly to a news article. Using it less recently.,0

152038,Super app for regular traders but also people interested in following markets,2
152039,"It is easy, but I think they need to take a hint from apple, Robinhood, and ally bank. Even, I hate to say it, but even the Menomonie Falls, WI Library. Organization and Ease is key. Then work on importing a wide range of banks, credit unions, (Roth) IRA, (Roth) 401K & 403(b,c), index fund, stock places, etc... It would be really great if Mint acted as, YOUR, place to go for U.S. finances. It would be great, if they went international and took the U.S. & International accounts together.",0
152040,"C'mon, make it like iphone.",0
152041,"Mint has been the easiest way to help me track finances, debt payments, and identify suspicious activity in real time.

152055,"Why have I only discovered this yesterday! I wish I knew about this app before!! You guys should do more ads so that people like me who absolutely love this thing but don't know it exists get some awareness.

152083,It is clear that no one making this actually uses it. If the app is started for the first time the data is correct but if you come back to it at different times later it can be absurdly wrong in a bunch of different ways. The disappointing thing is that it all looks really simple to fix if it was actually used.,6

152194,"I'm getting spam called now after signing up with this app. 10 times a day from different numbers. One I picked up because it was a mobile number and I got spiel about having signed up to other websites and it was nothing to do with this investing app. Even though I never mentioned the app, he managed to name it all on his own. Check mate. I'm just blocking them all but I don't need people ringing me asking what I want to buy. Thoroughly disgusted",79
152195,"Great app, very convenient",0
152196,It displays my accounts well enough but my credit card use shows a positive transaction making the budgeting feature useless and annoying.

When it says its incorrect, I will use my laptop, Im fine. On my cell, app or using a browser...incorrect. also, why is customer service no longer accessible?

152220,"Its' process for retrieving passwords is unintuitive and inefficient. If the online process does not work, it just redirects. You to the corporate website with no intuitive guides on where to go. The tool itself is not bad, but the app punishes you for not logging in at least once every thirty days. After that, it stops alerting you to transactions. That defeats the point of using it, if you are trying to spend less money.  It asks for a lot of personal information. While it needs your bank account info for a reason, It asks for a social security number for password retrieval. Why would something like that be necessary? If things work right on it, it is a great tool. When things go wrong, it is not helpful. I will be cancelling my account as soon as I can.",0

152252,I love the mint app. It makes keeping track of my money so easy. Instead of logging in to my computer to three or four different locations I have all my information in one place. I love the fact that you can make goals like saving for emergencies. I love to watch and see how close I am to reaching my goals. The best part is the budget portion. I never took the time to see how much I am making and how much I spend each month. The app made me realize I was over spending and I was able to cut back my spending.,0

153007,Overall it's great experience to track-down your expenses.,0
153008,I hesitated to download this because of the reviews that mentioned the connectivity issues but took the gamble hoping that tracking my expenses through this app would be more efficient than writing it down. Barely 2 weeks in and it can't connect to my CU. Thought maybe it was due to an upgrade in my CU's website b/c it had reported connectivity issues on that end.

153070,Upsetting. I've been a user of this app since the days of Pageonce and Check. The whole entire draw was the ability to see literally everything on ONE PAGE. Now I have to swipe through multiple ads and useless pages in order to actually use the app. It seems the development team has decided they need to push more advertisements and could not care less about actual user functionality. Time for me to find a new app.,7

It is putting in a $100 bi weekly payment since the massive list actually doesn't have my card or the bank that issued it as a 10,000.10 a year PAYMENT! That's just the start. I can't even get my 2nd bank to pull up in the list and it's a major institution.

153192,It doesn't stay connected to my accounts very well. Once a week or so I have to spend 20 minutes trying to reconnect my accounts.,2
153193,"Great until... I have used this app for more than a year and I tought I was the best ever! Ease of use, informative, real time (?) quotes. I could check my portfolio and keep an eye on other watchlist that I have created over time. However, last week I sold some stocks and I could not find any way to have that info reflected in my portfolio beside deleting the stocks. Wish there was an option to see liquidated stocks and its impact on my portfolio total gain or loss.",34
153194,As good as enough,0
153195,Is very nice,0

153199,"Some of the images in articles are too small and can't be made larger. Otherwise, great app!",0
153200,Best stock app that's out there. Real-time charts. Eventough they use the trading view charts. The trading view platform looks so cheap compared to investing. And most important its all free.,4
153201,Always updating financial news and accurate,0

153214,Should install this app,0
153215,"Top notch displays, charts, information.",0
153216,"App is pretty good, but it doesn't have all the features of the website. I only use it to categorize expenses. Budgets view is lacking because you can't see if your budgets match your anticipated income.",0
153217,I would like to be able to see my goals in the mobile app. UPDATE 12/27/20 Why do the goals in the mobile app differ from goals I have listed in the full mint website? The app goals are useless to me. I can't for example add a goal to save for a house etc. Why?,2
153218,"Nothing earth shaking about this app , but I find it handy for reminders about bills. Has an easy to use pin # instead of putting in user name and password. It is slow on the acquisition of data from Bank and credit card accounts. All in all I like it.",3
153219,Great way to have an overview of all your finances at your fingertips. Definitely makes mindful spending a little easier when you use a widget to see your checking balance on your home screen.,0
153220,Good but buggy! Keeps forgetting my watchlist,1
153221,Only first card of the credit report details loads,6
153222,Very fast simple n nice,0
153223,"Constant loop. Doesn't work at all. Add account just asks for verification code.. then make sure a person. Then verification, then code. Over and over again. Garbage. Was really hoping to use it.",4
153224,Would be great if there were more bank options. No Community America Credit Union? Always thought that was pretty popular...,2
153225,"Easy way to monitor the markets, stocks, and new all in one well organized place.",0
153226,"This App crashes whenever there is large activity. The portfolios you set up sometimes don't show up, the watchlists disappears time from time. I'm seriously regretting downloading this app, will look for other options now",8

153230,keep saying Please wait - we are verifying your account... on the sign in,3
153231,Great app! Thanks. Instant favourite. recommend. Strong recommendation!,4
153232,Extremely helpful and useful,0
153233,"Overall, great app! The only thing I would add is the ability to categorize transaction when I make it, as opposed to waiting for several days. For example, when I shop at a big box store sometimes I buy groceries and sometimes I buy household supplies. It is hard to remember which one is which several days after the transaction when Mint finally allows me to categorize it.",11
153234,"I just downloaded it and noticed few of my portfolios are not showing up despite having signed in. Aside from this, great app.",0
153235,Ok so my credit score changed but you give me NO details as to what happened so I can fix it. Useless app! Uninstalled again!,0
153236,Please send me 50k to pay 70k,0
153237,Doesn't track my list unless I sign in every time I use. Doesn't keep up with market changes.,3
153238,"No way to adjust line item cost for purchases made in another currency and it messes up my budget completely. I bought something for 3000 yen, not $3000! Conversion is about $30. If you fix it in the next app update, I will rate the app 5 stars. Otherwise, this app will continue to have 1 star. This sort of thing should be an editable option under ""Edit Details"" or if it already is an option, it should be easier to find! This was an issue years ago when I initially used Mint and it's weird that it hasn't been addressed for years.",15
153239,The only thing is that I forgot my password and requested to receive it or reset it but never received the email to make that happen.,0
153240,i didnt get money. EVEN when i invested nothing (except my time). WHATS UP WITH THAT,0
153241,"Would love to be able auto invest,as novice,verr good app.",0
153242,More information than I know what to do with.,0
153243,Awsome app. Loaded with info. Real time prices are great.,0
153244,"Can't add my major expense category which is gasoline, no customer support. I am interested in tracking expenses, they only use the option of setting things up as a bill to pay, rather than a receipt to log. I am also interested in simply scanning the barcode of my receipt for instant data input.",0
153245,Will not update until Directly Call Phone Numbers permission is explained. And will delete if not explained soon!,2
153246,Everything in one single app. ..,0
153247,Clean and easy to use interface. Feature request - notifications for transactions. I'd like push notifications on any activity in or out. This doesn't seem possible at the moment. Other than that. Great app.,1
153248,Stock markets best app,0

153250,Best app for keeping track of your finances.,0
153251,"Used to like this a lot but then an update lost all of the historical graphs at 3m, 6m and 1 yr. Would give it more stars if this was fixed. Update: They fixed the problem so they got their 5 stars back",0
153252,Keep me posted of my spending,0
153253,Very good App,0
153254,Informative easy to use and overall visually pleasing.,0
153255,"Update: Widget fixed! Thanks! Is there a way to rollback on update? I love this app, but the widget is malfunctioning since the update this morning. It will only allow a 4x1 view now, and only displays Summary no matter which option I select. I'd like my full screen of Balances back, please.",0
153256,"Best budgeting and financial planning app that I've used over the years. There is still room for improvement (can't work with budgets from past months, for example) but it is very useful and provides a way to visualize and monitor where you are with spending/saving.",0
153257,It's so good and not fake news...,0

153266,This app makes it easy to check on stock prices and market movement.,0
153267,"The team continues to impress. Been a longtime user of Mint and the app and if the minor updates didn't prove enough how great this app is, 2.7 does without question! Trends!!! Love this app. Makes managing money so much easier and fun!",0
153268,Horrible app. Keeps sending me news notifications though I used settings to try and turn them off. Uninstalled the app.,0

153271,Great way to see my full financial picture all at once! I also love the free credit reports.,0
153272,I can't log in go my bank DCU because they changed from a member number to a username and this app still requests the member number which doesn't work,0
153273,Very nice app.,0

153279,Easy to use.,1
153280,"wonderful, still need some more improvements",0
153281,"Good but could be better. I do think this app is good for creating budgets and monitoring your spending, but it loses 2 stars because I have to constantly verify my accounts. What's the point of adding my accounts if I have to verify them almost every day? Additionally, when I tried to verify some accounts, I was told they could not connect and should wait and try again, repeatedly.",32
153282,Had no problems at all....,0

153285,Excellent!!!,0
153286,"Works good, I like using it for a quick view of my holdings rather than logging into my platforms.",0
153287,"Puts your whole financial life into perspective. The app itself makes it easy to keep up with categorizing your transactions, which I've struggled with in the past. Five minutes a day using the app and Mint is MUCH more useful.",0
153288,Nice app. A tad slow. A tad unstable.,0
153289,"For a free app, it does the trick. Sometimes linking accounts doesn't work, but adding a bill/transaction is simple. Not sure if it's my phone or the app, but it does take a bit (few minutes) to load up and update every time I open the app.",2
153290,"Works...but like everything, could be better.",0
153291,Best app for checking trades,0
153292,Awesome news and data,0

153298,"After reinstalling and reopening a new account because it wouldn't work with my credit union new security features, I now get up to SEVEN emails per DAY about all kinds of nonsense that I don't care to read. I feel spammed. Also shows 'overdue' bills which were actually paid on time. On top of all that, it's attempting to sell me car insurance quotes by claiming I pay some outrageous amount for my premium; not even close to the truth. Where is this bogus data coming from? About to uninstall. This app used to be good now it's just trash.",3
153299,the best budgeting app there is have tried many and this one has all the right tools for people.,0

153307,"new UI just destroyed the app, used to be real simple and easy to use and see all the things you needed. now they just destroyed it and makes it a hassle to open the app and try to find your budget, transactions etc. edit: they reversed the UI upgrade and went back to the old version. so the app is much better to use now.",63

153316,I love it 😍😘 Amazing work team Thank you so much developer,0
153317,"It's ok. It would be better if all accounts actually updated. I have two that only update every few months. One that never updates. My former car loan is paid off but still shows up as inactive. To remove it, I'll have to remove all accounts from that institution. It's just annoying that it can't do that for itself.",7
153318,Completed first update from bank but doesn't update anymore,1
153319,Kinda useless without the ability to see the portfolio. Better to just use chrome and access direct on the Internet. Disappointed.,5
153320,Good for anyone,2

153326,Truck driver,0
153327,**UPDATE App went back to it's original interface which was great and now the app has stopped showing my upcoming bills. I got so accustomed to checking this app and using it to help me keep up that once it stopped showing them it threw me for a loop and got me all off track and I spent a while trying to go through all my bills and added them all to a new app on right dates. this one was my favorite though=( was great before this last update. now everything is mixed up and it's not user friendly.,12
153328,This one is staying until the issue is resolved. Otherwise app has been great. They fixed the issue with capital one,2

Mint's response was to include a Duplicate Entry checkbox to eliminate duplicates by hand, but they've done nothing to point them out to you and tracking down entries to mark is a serious chore.

153953,Little to do with finance. Mostly alt-right pandering.,0
153954,"I don't know how you all expect me to be able to sign I to your app when you disable auto fill on your sign in page. Why? Just why? This is absolutely ridiculous. Will edit review if issue is fixed. Thank you for the quick response, Mint! This did not solve the issue. This suggestion allows Google Assistant to expose my info if I ask it. ""Hey google, how much money is in my bank account"". It does not allow autofill to work on the text fields. In order to fix this issue, you need to ask your developers to change a line of code on their login page EditText element They have this line: android:inputType=""textPassword|textNoSuggestions"" They need to change it to: android:inputType=""textPassword"" The no suggestions flag is purely obnoxious and breaks regular android user's password managers.",9
153955,No doubt about this app im so satisfaction,0
153956,"I like the new update, nice aesthetic.",0
153957,Great app for big picture personal finances and goal tracking. YNAB is better for keeping track of daily expenditures and budgeting.,0
153958,"Very nice. At least check it out. If you don't like it, uninstall it. I use a credit union, so my bank never shows up on these things, but mint has it!",0
153959,Suits my needs. But PLEASE give the initial screen (enter security pin) an option to be able to exit on back button. I accidentally active the app and the only way to quit is through task manager kill app. Annoying.,0
153960,Great way to monitor your stocks!,0
153961,Great way to keep on top of business.,0
153962,Makes budgeting fun,0
153963,Won't let me log in...,0
153964,I can't use this app b/c it doesn't support MASTERCARD...? So I didn't even get past the 1st step to even try it out:-( What's up w/ that?,1

that it barely loads and seems to affect other apps.",0
153979,Excellent app for monitoring my trades,0
153980,"I really like Mint, so much that I am giving it 5 stars. The app itself is pretty basic, you can't do much but just get a very basic overview. I was hoping they would add more features, but the recent update doesn't add any features. EDIT: Removed two stars because the last update replaced the homepage with ads! Overview page is purposely harder to navigate too. I am fine with ads but this is absurd!",1
153981,good enough,0
153982,I like the recent update.,0
153983,So far so good I'll add 5 stars after I've had app awhile,0
153984,My favorite,0
153985,The price data is great for portfolio tracking and after hours is executed well on main screen but it's no longer useful for news yahoo serves up a strange salad of sources that rarely relate to why a stock is moving. For example press and earnings releases are often buried in other irrelevant stuff.,1
153986,Easy to setup. Good articles on stocks I follow.,2
153987,Updated & awesome,0
153988,Great app.. helps me out a lot,0

154000,"Good App, but still a little buggy. Aftermarket prices could use improvement",1
154001,Great for managing my finances.,0
154002,"I miss the old interface where it was easier to see my balances, due dates, and transaction details. Since that version is getting decommissioned in March I figured I'd start getting used to the new version...it's been 3 wks and I'm still not liking it. Hopefully they're still working on some improvements.",3
154003,I look at it everyday for stock futures and news.,0
154004,I love being able to quickly tap on this app and see the stocks I am following. Also a great news source! A little buggy at ties but other than that it's amazing,0
154005,"Love it, a lot of info for us",0
154006,I cannot believe this app is free!,0
154007,I love this app it is very useful,6
154008,"Good app. Simple, easy method of tracking my accounts, and making simple budgets. There are the occasional issues with connecting to certain accounts, but that seems to be more on the other end. Overall, I'd absolutely recommend it.",0
154009,Does what I wanted,0
154010,App won't allow you to unsubscribe,2
154011,Had some issues in the past with how my transactions were categorized. Decided to quick using for a couple of years. Redown loaded this year and am glad for some updates. I like how now I can see a list of recent transactions and adjust the categories to reflect the categories in my budget.Glad I decided to give it another shot.,1
154012,"Absolutely worthless now that I cant add one of my bank accounts.  Mint's ""temporary connectivity issue"" is permanent. If I cant have it all in one place there is no point in keeping the app, or my account for that matter. Buh-bye!",1
154013,"Love the app , meets my needs and keeps me on point with my finances & goals!!",2
154014,Good app news chart Everything is good,0
154015,70% accuracy in analysis,0
154016,Up the minute & relevant news.,0
154017,Have been using this for a while and it has improved over time.,0
154018,My portfolio list changed almost as soon as the merchant   M/A went through. Can't keep the same number of stocks in my list to show and it's so frustrating. Also way too many irrelevant ads when I'm trying to see relevant news/headlines associated with a particular stock.  Historical data used to let you choose a time frame--not anymore.  Can't think of a single positive change  sorry    Wish it would go back to the way it was   If it ain't broke then don't try to fix it (because usually you mess it up),0
154019,This app is horrible why can't I block dumb news outlets like reuters useless idiots!!!!!!,1

154030,Free info worth with high value.,0
154031,nice and easy to use,0
154032,Great to categorize your spending and budget accordingly BUT they need to incorporate the bill tracking feature of their other app into this one single app instead of having two apps!,0
154033,So you have cancelled YTD performance in order to activate back MAX performance? Why not both?,2
154034,Brother has on iPhone it works great so I got for my HTC EVO 4G works wonderful. Exceeds my finances,0
154035,"Desktop is more powerful, but app is good for quick checkups.",0
154036,New update ruins the app. Hugh adds for credit cards I already have. You use to be a trusted advisor. I have opened sever accounts because of your recommendations. NO MORE! Uninstalled.,1
154037,Respecting Mr Gentleman,0
154038,1apps but everything here. i am everyday open this side. it is easy to get all information of stock related.,0
154039,"I love this app! It helps me stick to my budget and reach my financial goals. The only feature I wish it has was a cash flow tracker. I am paid biweekly, so it can be difficult to make sure I have enough money in my checking account to cover my bills. This is especially difficult when my credit card bill and rent are paid within the same pay period.",2
154040,Fastest way to check accounts at a glance.,0
154041,UDF translates over to United Airlines on the app and thinks I have spent $180 on travel so far this month.,0

154051,So far so good (minus it always disconnecting from pqypal) we'll see how it goes.,0
154052,life saver. so simple,0
154053,Bad experience with trolls who will change their username to yours and upload your profile picture in an effort to appear as if they are you. Yahoo has a button to report same but after many attempts to report in hopes of them removing the troll account I am convinced they could care less,0
154054,Keeps me up to date with all the key trends and pricing I need!,2
154055,Best budgeting App,0
154056,My only concern is the app view of budget is a little confusing. If I set something to be paid on a particular date it shows as due now... could just be my view I'm new to using it so I'll mess around a not more this could be user error. Bit Great App over all,0
154057,Super helpful and easy to use! Highly recommended.,0

154067,Very responsive and functional.,0
154068,"This app doesn't show the ""Book Value"" of your cryptocurrency investments. It only shows the current ""Market Value"". The app should incorporate both book value AND market value so investors can see if their investments are making or losing value.",4

154080,This is a app on a growth scale.,0
154081,"My numbers historically are incorrect now. And the new UI is buggy, showing categories twice in the budget. Mint seems to be getting worse..",1
154082,I mainly got this app to keep track of how much I spend. I like that I can easily see when I'm reaching my budget and see what's my net income for every month.,0
154083,Easy to use and keeps me on top of what's going on.,0
154084,I have downloaded various apps to help me with my budget and this app iced the cake. Is simply amazing. I'm still trying to figure out if I can export my budget to excel. Any tips?,0
154085,It's kind of useless without the portfolio view. A major step backwards.,0
154086,Was good initially. The recent censorship in the forums is horrible. Swearing or mocking others is one thing but not allowing the freedom to share facts is another.,0
154087,Great app; not perfect but does what i need it to do,0
154088,"From these few months investing keep loading and can not show my list. Hoping some update to fix it like before, but until now still no update, what's wrong? Already re-install few times. Investing very useful for me.",5

154104,Brings all of your finances together into one attractive package!,0
154105,"Good app. The issue I have is that transaction are duplicated. Makes it seem as if I have spent double the money. It's good for keeping up with spending. However, results would not be accurate.",0
154106,Would like to see live audio only for listening while driving.,0
154107,Actually really helped me get our budget on track. It's a great tool to steer the big ship called your budget. I recommend keeping your budget categories pretty simple instead of creating a category for every item.,1
154108,Nice service,0
154109,The only budget application I ever use.,0
154110,Great app. Very easy to use and very useful.,0
154111,"Great app for budgeting and getting an overview of all your accounts. It does take some time to link whatever accounts you want to link, and occasionally sign-in issues come up for some accounts, but, once you have it all connected, it's super helpful to have all your investments, expenses, and budgets in one place.",4
154112,"Waste of time. Tried to read a number of articles and got redirected to sign up for CNBC Pro, cannot register for it and no app to add. What is the point of posting articles that we cannot access. Also cannot add the app to my new android tablet. How is that possible!",28

Also I got a loan and trying to add it and I keep getting the error message that the system is expericing issues with adding it and I should try back later. What's the point of having this app if it can't monitor all of my accounts?,0

154134,"People call from cyprus being rude, call you gay, depressed, say that swedes are ignorant and that I HAVE to give salespeople 10min of my time. Dont sign up for the service, they exploit your data, not gdpr compliant and they harass you, while not identifying who they are. SHADY!",0
154135,"Very helpful economic news. I especially follow commodiries and it is geared toward tracking primarily the stock market. It would be nice if I could set it to open up with the ticers & graphs for the markets I follow first, but otherwise a very useful app.",0

154137,"Wish there was a little more functionality within the app, like on the site.  However it is great for on the go!",1

154139,"This app is great for seeing my finances at a glance but I can say it isn't as reliable as I would like. It has a really hard time updating, sometimes taking days to have all the transactions listed, even when I am constantly refreshing it and everything is up to date in my accounts. If it would actually have accurate information all the time I would easily give it five stars, but I can't trust the amount it shows me.",0

154145,Good job with the app guys. Love it.,0
154146,"Not pleased with app support. An annoying new ""feature"" appeared on the overview screen: A bubble for ""live help"" which I will never use, and whose smiling visage takes up screen space and cannot be dismissed. I chat with customer care, who don't investigate my issue because I can't provide a screenshot (the app itself blocks screen capture). They basically tell me that's too bad, and say to submit my problem to an online ""suggestions"" page. ""I don't want to help you"" is what I heard.",4
154147,No complaints,0

154150,Good synergy of stock data and articles. But graphs are basic. Technical graphs would be a pleasant improvement.,0

version.",0
154168,Great app. Loyal user for almost 10 years,0
154169,Helps me stay on top of my finances and when and where I spend. Keeps track of receipts better than I do. Bear in mind I'm only in my twenties. I recommend this for those who are ready to be money conscious.,0

154210,"A great app to track your spending, manage loan or credit card debt, and check your credit score all on one place. Its pretty intuitive to use and easily synced with my financial accounts.",2
154211,User friendly and well organized! Love how it categorizes spending and makes different charts and graphs. great way to keep track of spending and create budgets!,0
154212,Site will not for some reason rotate on my tablet,0
154213,"does this app make you happy? what kind of stupid question is that? but anywho, great app, easy navigation, the theme is easy on the eyes if you have sensitive eyes to Bright Lights, constantly up to date, he also has a setting so your screen will not turn off when you have this app on which I really like. it does have a few ads but not to the point that annoys the hell out of you.",9
154214,VERY NICE QUICK BEAUTIFUL COLOURED SCREEN.VERY USEFUL.THANKS.,0
154215,Absolutely great app for tracking my expenses!,0
154216,"I just removed the app yesterday after only using for about a week. The app still doesn't have a real time line for banking information, ie; current actual balance and current actual transactions, so how does it help to stay on budget if the time line is inaccurate?",0
154217,"This app is great, but if you are going to say that i can either input my email OR username, it needs to actually process my email. It will not allow me to login unless i input my username, and thats a bit silly only because you say i can do both. Unnecessary hinderance to my financing.",1
154218,Because of this i am able to know the status of the market,0
154219,"This is weird! I tried to install this and got a dialog saying ""Cannot install because another user has installed an incompatible version on this device."" I am the only user of this phone, a Samsung Galaxy S10+. Do you know anything about this? Since it's a money related app, I am a bit scared.",0
154220,Great app. Only thing I will say is that when the app gets updated it tends to require a re log-in and a reset for calendar settings.,1
154221,App is not acting right.,0
154222,Invaluable. I check it every few days to categorize my most recent purchases and monitor my spending. The trends and charts are really useful. I like looking over them every few months to make sure the accounts income and spending are behaving as expected.,0
154223,works good for me handy,0
154224,Does what I need it to do,0

154235,Somehow when running this app I need to restart the phone call together.,0
154236,The experience of this app is significantly different compared to the iOS version of it. It stops loading the articles (5-10) abruptly after scrolling down and takes a heck a lot of time to load a few more. This has nothing to do with internet speed and not sure why this was not tested. I even tried different phones pixel and Nexus and still the same case.,2
154237,How do you get your news so fast?,0
154238,Charts do not load longer time periods. A decent source of news however.,0
154239,The app is very good but has some quirks with some institutions not always syncing. GE with Amazon is always manual and still doesn't work.,0
154240,It is even better than before. I wish the font size could be adjusted thou.,0
154241,The app became useless after payment of two years subscription of 71.70 USD.😠 Be very careful. Don't subscribe 😠 Only use free version. Free version has more features 😠 Never subscribe paid version Never subscribe,0
154242,Excellent app,0

154246,difficult to sync accounts,0
154247,Convenient. Intuitive.,0
154248,"Account synchronization functions much better Feb21, than when I first tried it Nov19. Makes a great quick look at account balance and budget spending and other longer-term items like net worth, and total credit debt, along with many other tools of course.",1
154249,so far so good,0
154250,Downgraded to 1 star... I have to uninstall the App. No longer going to use the App. It just crashed today. Missing some companies. My favorites just disappeared? 😕☹,0

154252,Doesn't cover other markets.,0
154253,This app is useful to get quick quotes on stocks I'm following. There is also recent news. It's a keeper.,0
154254,It's excellent app,0
154255,"Great way to monitor financial accounts, well at least those that sync. App is slow updating accounts.",1
154256,"Then I got a LG Connect running on MetroPcs and now nothing. I mean nothing. Mint is sure there is no data conection, dispite the fact every other app on the phone can find it. It used to work great on my first gen iPhone and my older Andriod handset( also on MetroPcs) and now nothing.",0

154279,Simply put it is an indispensable biz app,0
154280,App works with Android 4.4.,0
154281,"For some reason, categorization rules are not allowed on investments but they are on cash accounts. This seems like an issue that should be fixed. Having reinvestments categorized as sports goods or paychecks categorized as investments is weird to not be able to fix yourself automatically for the future. Not sure why this design distinction was made. Reporting bugs requires two way chat instead of a feedback button easily accessible. Preserving people's time would be a better experience.",18

154311,Good and brief and quality information.,0
154312,"I've been using this app for years and it's really been an awesome tool. Earlier this year, they rolled out done major changes that made the app much less user friendly but they apparently listened to complaints and rolled back those changes. I couldn't be happier and so long as the app continues to be user friendly, I'll keep using it (I'm always open to changes, so long as they don't make ads and promotions more important than usability).",2
154313,More commodity news needed,0

154343,its up to date with all daily info,0
154344,not nearly as good as the previous.,0
154345,Great tools,0
154346,Barely kept track of my transactions. If anything it confused me even more. It wouldn't update my transactions for days and the amount I had in my account was never right,1
154347,Why do you put news notifications under general notifications? If I turn off general notifications to kill the news spam I no longer get price alerts. Please move the news notifications under the correct area.,1
154348,"It's been extremely helpful with following up on my investments and relevant updates. It has really cool tools to keep track of my investments such as the watch list, portfolio, alarms for certain market movements, etc. However the app freezes at certain times and reboots and that's why it's not a 5 star yet for me.",35

154369,Just shoves articles on you. No way to stop them. The info and resources the app provides are nice. Just cant stand the constant notifications about articles I dont care about.,1
154370,"I can understand refreshing accounts when I open the app, but after every cash transaction I enter, it refreshes again. And I can't just do it while it refreshes because when it finishes refreshing, it goes back to the main screen. If I'm only doing one transaction it's not an issue, but if I have multiple, it takes too long. Also, I don't know how much data it uses to do this, but refreshing multiple times in just a few minutes is absurd. Also, it not as if my accounts are going to change that quick.",1
154371,"Wide variety of news sources, multiple perspectives, easy format,.graphs, and flow. 10 xs better then those other fools who push hedged funded materials and F.U.D So far, primary source of data above others.",4

154472,Mint is a superb tool for keeping track of loan and credit card balances and monitoring transactions across all accounts to check for fraudulent purchases. I use it every day. It also lets you download all transactions for the year into spreadsheets. The budgeting and analysis features are also helpful and easy to use. A++ App!,0

154482,We use Mint in our church to communicate financial information among all the authorized buyers & our CPA. Works great & is pretty close to real time. While there are many tools that do this' we prefer to protect our banking information from internet predators & Mint affords us that protection but w/virtual real time communication. I have recommended to others many times.,0
154483,Great for anyone looking to physically see and manage their money. It helps a lot. The support staff are amazing and quick to answer your questions.,0

154485,best app ever,0
154486,So im not sure whats wrong with it but I just tried to link multiple accounts but it keeps freezing and not letting me link accounts. I tried to Uninstall it and reinstall it and its still not working. Won't use it again.,0

154488,Does what it says it does.,0
154489,"I wish a few more features were available on the app, but it is not broken the way it is now. A great, simple way to keep track of spending. Thank you, Mint, and please continue to keep my info secure.",0
154490,"Great app on so many levels. Updates instantaneously and has been working great so far. Most recently connectivity issues have been arising. I have not been able to connect to my credit card account which is an EZcard account. I don't use that account a lot, so it was OK. Now all my Chase accounts won't connect too, so this app is rendered pretty much useless with this bug. This has been going on for 3 days now. I hope this bug can be taken care of. Thanks.",1
154491,Really easy to grasp. I have been using this app as an entry point in creating a portfolio to invest in.,0
154492,"As a fellow Android dev, I am really impressed with the design, functionality, and ease of use of this app. It does everything I got it for and more, and doesn't have any of the annoying ""missed opportunities"" other apps have. I don't find myself thinking ""I can't believe Mint doesn't have this thing"". It's all there. Great work team!",8
154493,"Practical, friendly",0
154494,It will no longer sync. Sounds like I am not the only one having the problem. Droidx,0

154500,"I think this app is very frustrating to use on my phone! I continuously get connectivity errors when i open the app and update my accounts. More often than not, I have to re-enter my account info to get an update, even though the information was correct the last time i was logged in. Usually i have to enter the information two to three times before i get a successful update. I've used my home wifi and my phones data, same errors. it works fine on my computer. issue lies within app.",0
154501,Great way to know your credit score and keep a tap on credit card use. Also helps you find unusual activity,0

154505,I need to keep track of our finances and Mint complements my bank apps.,1
154506,Problem open,0
154507,Last time I used this app was 4 years ago when I had a DROID Eris. Now I revisit the Android platform as a developer myself and appreciate how difficult maintaining an excellent app like this is. 100% improvement and 5 stars.	Mint works great on my computer and ipad. I can never log in on my Eris with this app though. Very unhappy with the app.,0
154508,The app works great and has great articles.  Data is displayed in a clean format.,0
154509,Not great at all,0
154510,Sweet application,0
154511,My day won't complete without using this one! Is outstanding to keep track of global financial events!,0
154512,"After an update, It is loading for too long",1
154513,This is a pretty decent app but it doesn't access all bank accounts. Like Regions Bank for example keep having difficulty signing in through the app but when I log in with the same credential info through the bank website I can view my funds just fine. It's super annoying. If that can be fixed this would be a great app overall,9
154514,"i like the articles. and like i said has a lot more. i actually thought of only giving it 4 stars because maybe it could be better, then i thought about it and couldnt really think how it could be. i didnt think that would be fair.",0

154522,"Probably the best mobile app out there for tracking news and looking into fundamentals for stocks. Needs some work on the technical side of though, charts are basic.",0
154523,Let's do this,0
154524,Still working through the features.  Being able to track spending against set budgets is great!  Just what I was looking for.	Easy and very informative.,2
154525,"Sure do love how it gathers information automatically, now I don't have to go in and enter in every little thing manually if I want accurate information! Something I'd really like to see is options on timeframes you are viewing especially in budgets and trends instead of being forced to the set parameters in the app.",0
154526,Pretty good app. Can see market changes in real time,0
154527,Yahoo is nothing more than a liberal think tank. Your views are so skewed against Trump and conservative values it makes me puke. I no longer view any news published by Yahoo. grow a pair and report fairly.,0
154528,Works like a charm.,0
154529,Need to get splits on stocks in past,0

154555,I love it. Good for budgeting. Gives you a clear view of your accounts at a glance.,0
154556,Mint is great for tracking daily expenses as well as setting up budgets and goals. It's intuitive and easy to set up too.,0

154560,Best Financial apps ever!!!,0
154561,Good app covering all aspects of finance plus all markets across globe.,4
154562,Feels like Yahoo is running tests on their production. I'm tired of all those bugs appearing on every other app version. What happened to the widget ?? It used to be a good app once.,5
154563,"The app is pretty good, the website is much better. This app is lacking a lot of features from the website, it is dumbed down to much in my opinion. Even something like creating new tags has escaped this app.  It's mostly useful for a really basic overview with limited other functionality.",0
154564,I am trying!!!;,0
154565,Very good for indians,0
154566,Really helpful and user friendly app to keep track of our family budget and bills.,0

154580,A Very good app,0
154581,Net positive and higher savings every month I use this app.,1
154582,"I've used Mint for years. The recent change in look for the app meant I lost my favourite feature: goals, which allowed me to set up a goal like pay down my credit card balance or everymonth put money in savings/RRSP. It's also been a bit glitchy with the update. The app is still great, connects to all sorts of financial isntitutes to have complete look at financial health. Setting up a budget is easy. But I personally want a more proactive planning to my budget that Mint doesn't offer.",12
154583,"This would beawesomeif you added bills due, etc",0
154584,Like the app. It gives me quick view of the stocks.,1
154585,Great for keeping my finances in order.,0
154586,"The customer support team alone is worth 5 stars, let alone the app.  You guys are awesome!!!",2
154587,"I do wish more features from the site translated over to the app better though. And I can't add my car loan because while the app recognizes Wells Fargo, it doesn't recognize Wells Fargo Dealer Services, which is a different site and branch. Still pretty cool though.",8
154588,"Contiene artículos de opinión muy interesantes, además de toda la información de los mercados",0
154589,"Shows accounts that are no longer existing,  duplicates some accounts, shows incorrect balances.",0
154590,The latest updates caused duplicate transactions and missing transactions. The budget does not match the transactions anymore. Update: the latest updates keep getting worse. No longer getting the duplicate transactions but the budgets are still not adding up. One of my budgets is multiple times off. It's been a rough year with the app and I'm finding it less and less useful since I can't trust it.,29
154591,Only USA and Canada,0
154592,"I love using this app, it helps me keep control on my budget, but it needs more opens, like when I move money for savings, there isn't a transaction label for anything for savings.",0
154593,was working well until the last update. Now force closing all the time!,3
154594,Really handy app. Consolidates everything so you don't need to click as much to see what's going on in your accounts.,0
154595,Good information and tracking,1
154596,I love the widget but it's not as useful when you have to manually refresh due to data being way out of date.  I use it for quick balance check and the old every 4 hours was OK.  Now that is removed I'm probably going to look for alternatives.,1
154597,Love needs more explanations but awesome,0
154598,App continued to give me the message that my accounts wouldn't load due to temporary connection issue. Accounts never loaded.,0
154599,Very good app,0
154600,Love the app. Some times have to fix categories but great otherwise for tracking my money,0
154601,"So much potential yet not enough effort given in this app development. When app starts it just shows watchlists names ... Can't switch to watchlist by clicking on the name. Have to click on My watchlists breadcrumb at the top, select a watchlist and only then will show the details... Very poor design.  App frequently crashes when you move away from it.   And those ads make the whole experience even worse.i understand the model but you are really pushing the limits here.  Unfortunately despite all of this Y Finance is still the only app who aggregates information and makes it available freely to users and thus the 2 stars.",9
154602,"My daily tool, ads are annoying",0
154603,"The dashboard and tools are great but it is unable to connect 2 accounts, including my mortgage. I've been dealing with their ""support"" for weeks and they keep ""elevating"" it only to come back and tell me I'm entering the wrong credentials. That's not true. I'm able to log into the banks website consistently without fail and I've sent Mint screenshots showing this. It's really frustrating (1) that they have this issue and (2) that their people won't do anything to fix it. You get what u pay for.",31

154611,"Not a huge fan of the new update that was released this month. I've been a Mint customer for about 2 years now, and it seems more and more ads keep getting in the way of viewing my finances. I think the new UI is great, but it is seriously overgrown with credit offers, loan options, and investment opportunities. I am good on all those, and I'd rather just have a simple screen telling me my finances. Will be looking to other alternatives if this doesn't get cleaned up. I get you need to make money, so why not just make a paid app instead of littering partner ads everywhere?",4

154616,"I was hoping mint had fixed problems that caused me to leave them several years ago. Sadly, their support team is still terrible. My accounts within mint randomly break and I have to reconnect them. Plus, I use a certain credit card provider which mint doesn't want to connect with so I can get account updates. Uninstalled.",0
154617,latest update destroyed the updates,0
154618,Nice interface. Just what I was looking for in a watchlist app. News articles are good although the advertisements are annoying.... But the app is free! Allows you to set currencies in watchlist. Charts are good and stock data is detailed.   Would be nice if I can make the total overview amount ignore specific watchlist and if I could control the currency of the total amount.,10

You are able to connect anywhere you are spending money (mortgage, car loan, bank, etc.) It makes it so much easier to come up with and stick to a budget. You're also able to set-up a plan if you are wanting to reach a savings goal by a certain date, and they'll let you know how much you need to save a month to achieve that goal. The app is also very user friendly and I haven't had any issues that haven't been resolved quickly.",0

Probably more of a concern when I have more money and would be more of a target. The app isn't like 10/10 straightforward to use but it's pretty good.

154923,This app was highly recommended but has yet to live up to the hype. Every month USAA doesn't update and I'm left chatting or emailing to get it to reflect properly. Other accounts repeatedly ask to be signed in but are stuck on security questions or phantom issues that aren't on account's actual website. This new layout after the recent update makes it inconvenient to see what's most important forcing a search of multiple screens. What should be a helpful app is turning into a nuisance.,2

155097,"I rated this app in the basis that it reports slower than other apps. The 
information is all correct and the UI is very friendly, but the news, 
however, seems to come about 10-25 minutes behind peers. This is very 
important to anyone that may be inclined to trade in a fast pace manner as 
the news can have swift implications on the market. I assume the target 
audience here is not fast pace traders but casual users just observing 
occasionally.",0
155098,"When it works, it's great. But it's connection to my bank keeps breaking. It asks me my bank's security questions, but then it never registers my answer.

155111,Much better than it used to be. Raising from 2 to 4 stars. Still some error on landscape graph. Time interval on right hand side sometimes gets stuck with 2 time frames highlighted and won't update the graph. Closing landscape with the X and re-opening resets it.,9

Update: Sept. 2012: After trying Mint a second time just to give it another chance, because I was fed up of entering every transaction manually, I see that it STILL has a montly budget cycle which does NOT correspond to cash flow and bi-weekly or weekly paycheques that most people get, I am giving up on it AGAIN! The only good thing - it automatically downloads your transactions from your bank accounts which saves you entering most transactions except cash transactions.  When will financial budget software developers LEARN to make apps which correspond to the REAL world instead of the FINANCIAL or ACCOUNTING world?  If Mint had the cash flow abilities of NDLs ""Cash Flow"" app, combining them both, it would be a perfect app of 5 stars!",1

156531,Why in god's name would you prevent me from taking screenshots of my own transactions? Just because Android has this permission doesn't mean you should use it. You want feedback? Me feedback is you adding this block is idiotic and you should fix it. It's really getting in a way of expense management from a phone,0
156532,"Overall, a good app to track your finances in one place. Although, transaction classification is terrible and I'd prefer not having this feature at all. The overall good experience, of course, holds true until the first major data breach, which is not an ""if"", but ""when"", given how modern software is written.

Refresh feature doesn't really refresh the accounts. I have used this app for 2 years now but with the recent update it has become awful. The most important concern is now to try to sell you things instead of budgeting. Disappointed!",1

Kind of throws me off when I see that I've spent $200 in gas when I only spent $100. Transactions are also miscategorized making each category always over budget. On top of all of that, transactions take a long time to load.  It's not loaded at end of the day but like a week or two later.  Uninstalling and looking for something else.",0

I can't see how to look at previous months expenses on the pie chart, does not seem like you can. Nor how to see my loans. I don't understand why they wouldn't have the  Loans in with the main accounts with a running balance since it is a liability. For those reasons I will be uninstalling.",0

156661,Interface is cluttered and cannot access detailed budget and stats on previous months.  I had a much better experience with the Windows Phone version of Mint.  I like the material design but the UX is horrible on Android.  Simplify the layout and allow drill down of data,8

156777,"I've used the app for years, but at one point I started seeing multiple copies of the same transactions.  For example, I visit a restaurant on June 5th and it shows that purchase on the 5th and the 13th. This happens to most, but not all, my purchases across all credit cards.  I've been using a different app now, but was surprised to see today that it's still not fixed. It really plays havoc on the budget feature and spending alerts.  Update: it's been almost two years since I posted this review and the issue of every transaction showing double is still there!",9

I love the lay out and I can link my bills to the app. I know that seems a little sketchy to some people but there is a lot of security on the app. I am loving it and really hope it helps me with spending. I had no idea how much I was spending on useless things! I highly recommend this app!,2
157483,"I love Mint and use it almost daily on my computer. Unfortunately, the app is missing many important features. I can't edit my income budget or even see it. The app is not a way to manage your budgets - it's a way to view a some of your budget info.",0
157484,"Good app for budget tracking except that it inexplicably and inaccurately identifies expenditures incorrectly. For instance, a recent purchase at Target was identified by the app as ""unusual spending on bills and utilities."" The app sent me an email to this effect. This happens quite often and thus renders the app useless if using notifications to keep track of spending in order to adhere to your budget. I really do like the app so please fix this.",0
157485,"Okay app. The widget showing all debt vs all cash is very useful. I can see my transactions. I can see all my accounts, BUT there's no way to exclude my savings from JUST the overall cash sum, which is rally what matters and there's no way to dig into my budgets and really play around with them in the app. it doesn't have all the functionality of the websit.",0
157486,It's good app for monitoring the trades....,0
157487,would not update to my recent transactions. I have to manually put them in? I thought it was automatically update. so it was alright. not my favorite.,0
157488,What else do you need?,0
157489,"Definitely the best app for monitoring, markets, news, portfolios and stocks.",1
157490,When I first started using thus app I left it a pretty rotten review. Thus was 5 yrs ago and now I'm completely sold. I LOVE IT! It has completely helped manage my finances. I literally use it for all my accounting and budgeting purposes.,0
157491,Never have had a problem with it. Works great! *****,0
157492,Helps with paying bills. Keeps everything in one place. Love it,0
157493,"I really really wanted to try this app out due to all of the great reviews. Upon installing it, I found that syncing your bank account is not an option, but a requirement. That feels a little intrusive..Its basically the first step when in the setup. I do not feel comfortable linking my bank accounts/refuse to do so and therefore am unable to get any further in the setup to even get to the actual program itself.Maybe a future app where you are not forced to give up your personal account info...?",0
157494,"Won't update no matter how many times I refresh even weeks after a transaction... I even tried to delete and reinstall a few times. This app became useless, so I deleted my account completely. Now I'm in search for different financial manager app.",0

157503,"It used to let you trend your spending by category, but after the visual overhaul, this is most definitely no longer possible. You can see your individual transactions by category, but then you have to add it up yourself instead of it totaling it for you. It was the one thing I used this app for. Taking functionality away makes no sense.",5
157504,"This is a ""must have"" tool for anyone following the market. I find it the best for me because it is the easiest to use and understand.",0

157508,"It won't let me log in, says my information is wrong but it's not, considering deleting. Thus used to be a great app when it was check.",0
157509,"I love the idea of this app. I can access my personal and business account at the same time. However I feel like I don't have the control I'd like. When I manually add something, I can't change or delete it. I can't change the budget setup. It freezes and crashes a lot, especially through the widget. I can't change the widget to only view the accounts individually. The overview needs an option to make the account separate, both accounts are use for different things.",0

157569,Mint changed their login function to where it operates through Intuit and now I am locked out of my account. Therefore I am left with no alternative but to uninstall your app.,1
157570,The app was not useful for me so I tried to delete it. I literally had to contact customer service to do so.. they don't make it easy. Then I was informed that it may take up to 45 days to completely delete the account. Wth? So sorry I even chose this app for my budgeting needs.,0

157576,"The app is great, real time. Except ONE most annoying thing. On main stock columns, When the price changes, it flashes a different color, by the  time your eyes see it and move there (fraction of second) its back to pre color position and you have no idea where the stock price was and if it went up or down.  I usually then jump to another app and see the movement because the other chart shows the fluctuations up or down and where it was before.    Simply put...if developers held the color and box around the changed stock or index price longer WITH a simple pos or neg symbol and a separate column to the left of the current stock price showing exact cost of the movement just flashed.    Again great app. Just too fast for eyes to see change.  Of course i remedy the quickness by memorizing the prices, but its difficult to do when the list has 10 stocks present and each stock can have 7 digits.",0

158001,Very good app.,3
158002,Great app when it works.  Always crashes on my samsung galaxy II when downloading latest transactions.  After a reboot I'm then able to see my up to date transactions.  Get the problems resolved and then it would be worthy of 5 stars.,25
158003,Good app but the price change is slower than other apps,0
158004,Didn't blow up the device,0
158005,Can't even view half the stuff on this app that you can online. Both suck but this app is trash. Where are the goals you set? Why can't I see them..? Ridiculous app.,0

158023,Yearly Candlestick Charts not available,0
158024,I like how I can see all my credit card spending in one place as well as investment accounts. This and credit karma are both very helpful. Only feature I'd like to see implemented is a section to add car loans/paid off. Also useful to monitor credit score. Would also be nice to see how much credit score would rise if you pay off certain amounts.,9
158025,Rubbish app. In dire need of an overhaul.,0
158026,I would pay for this if they could get rid of the duplicates,0

158036,"Website is good, app is confusing.",0
158037,Won't connect to my bank.  It's a known issue for the last 3 months but they have not addressed it.  App doesn't function at all without a bank account tied to it.,0
158038,great app! should also try to incorporate foreign accounts with different currencies...by converting them in USD using the most updated currency conversion.,1

158042,Quick and convenient continual updates.,0
158043,Great tool... But the accounting is not perfect. Debits and Credits are off. Overall it helped me get out of debt! So that part is good. I was able to track my spending,3
158044,Why does it get killed (dissapears) when I move to home screen ? Then I need to open the app again. Is it intended ?,1
158045,Using Mint has helped me stay on top of my finances. In the past I would get hit with different fees and high credit card rates. Thank you Mint!,0
158046,Best app to add your portfolio. Read financial news economics data,0
158047,It has all the info I need on stocks and is easy to use.,0
158048,Mint is a great app.... When it works. It barely ever manages to update my account even when I restart my phone and the app several times. It becomes useless when it can't give me an accurate balance.,2

158058,Very realistic,0
158059,"I  was a user of Mint Bills since it was Pageonce and Check and was a HUGE fan. I am very disappointed that it's been discontinued. Was hoping that the features that made Mint Bills so easy to use would have been incorporated here, but no such luck. There isn't a good way to refresh select accounts. You have to wait until every single account is done reloading, and it is painfully obvious that the refresh is unsuccessful. I also loved how Mint Bills listed the credit/debit below each account's general info, leaving you with a quick rundown of the transactions. The Overview from Mint Bills was also more straightforward. If you're going to try merging the apps, please make this one more user-friendly and customizable. In my opinion this is a poor replacement for the ease in which Mint Bills operated. The accounts seem to only really refresh once every few days instead of in real-time. The new app is also incredibly buggy. I am constantly having to re-enter login information which defeats the whole purpose. You're better off signing into 95 different websites individually them using this app. This merge was a TERRIBLE move. I'll be researching other apps to use instead.",2

158065,Horrible wants to much personal info and to link bank accounts and credit card to much personal info they want access for big security risk just need to manually add my bill and cost and have app to tell what's left no need for all my personal info to be had,0

I have zero need to see/show my entire life's saving's on my homescreen (what the widget currently does), but if they can add widgets that show my spending within a budget, or across all my budgets for the month. Well, then Boom! 5 star rating.  Other ideas: a quick add for a transaction widget. or a widget that shows your last 5 (or more?) transactions with a quick link to edit and categorize. Seriously. think about it.",0
158181,"Very good app. Some of the most needed improvements: support for holding portfolios (kind of annoying to switching between the desktop website and the app to track that), app having a tendency to close itself in the background too quickly thus requiring a full refresh often, some RNS are not available (FTSE AIM).",4

158208,"I live this app because it allows me to see all of my money in one place, all of my accounts sync up with it so I can see exactly how much money I have and all of the transactions that I've made.

My S5 can normally go 2 days on a single charge. With the Mint Widget running, I was concerned as to whether I would make it through the work day without having to top-up.

I use this app on my phone and logging into the website to create categories is a big issue because the website doesn't have a mobile version, thus the print is so small, it's useless.

158326,"This is the worst app...  Number 1: it is basically only available in Canada & USA  Number 2: when I downloaded it, there was no tutorial on how to use it leaving you at a complete loss on how to navigate it and track expenses  Number 3: I tried linking my UK account but nothing shows up. There is basically no proof that my account is on there. Then when I tried readding my account to mint it says my UK bank account is already on there.   This app is nothing but confusing to try and navigate.   Honestly, just a waste of space on a your smart phone",1
158327,"Update: Did the suggested Uninstall/Reinstall dance again. This time it's much better. However, I still sometimes have to Force Stop the app to kill the audio.

158344,"Not useful app. Developers need to understand that for any portfolio two views are important - First the performance i.e. how well it is doing (profit/loss); Second the Transactions i.e. Buy / Sell qty, date & price info. For proper info, stock split, bonus, dividends etc need to be incorporated in back end as for users it would be cumbersome.  GUI can be made easier. For example, to delete list, why we need to open the list & then delete, the same can be provided outside. How to view/add/delete individual transactions ?  Used Import Google portfolio feature, but then for most stocks details are not available. Looks like there is a lot of mapping issue. E.g. TATASTEEL in Google portfolio is TATASTEEL.NS in Yahoo portfolio. There is no easy option to change this also. Problem does not end here. Even total market value is shown wrong for many cases.   Overall unreliable & not useful. In depth understanding of its usage needs to be studied by developers. They can check google portfolio which is near perfect but unfortunately going to close down.",24

158426,"The high rating of the app is mostly due to reviews from over a year ago. Since then Intuit designers have with each release made the core feature of the app - the ability to see how your budgets are holding up for the current month - harder and harder to find. I don't think most people could figure out how to see the status of their current month's budgets, which used to be right on the front screen. Product and service offerings should be on their own tab like earlier releases. We should not have to drill down into multiple screens to use basic features. The biggest issue though is the app continues to have discrepancies in the dollar amounts between screens when viewing the same metric. For example, even with the most recent bug fixes applied as of 6/2021 the monthly ""spent"" dollar amount and the total dollars spent so far on the budget screen do not always match. I had to roll back to an earlier release (pre butchered UI) to see consistent dollar amounts between screens. When this is finally fixed I will likely upgrade back to current version, although honestly the usability of the older (pre 2021) versions are much better than the current offering.",21

159480,"It made me log into my accounts, which was annoying. After all that hassle, a couple accounts were not showing the correct info. Could not manually fix, or add credit card info. It kept showing my credit balance for an account as an upcoming payment amount instead the actual payment amount autopay scheduled. It showed my PayPal credit as... checking/or an empty account; not as a credit card and not as something with an upcoming payment. It seems like a nice app, but not for me.",22
